          <h3>choosing colors</h3>
          <img src="images/choosing-design-colors.png" alt="" />
          <div>
            <p>
              of course any color you make you add it in your style as a
              variable so when you need to modify it you do it from one place
            </p>
            <p>
              first you start by choosing your primary color, you can pick it
              either:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                by the website vibes using the
                <a href="#color-phsycology">color phsycology</a>
              </li>
              <li>or from a provided theme</li>
              <li>or from the logo</li>
              <li>
                or from the hero section (on your own or using the theme extract
                in adobe color)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              then you choose your secondary color either by knowing color
              harmony or using one of these
              <a href="#color-picking-websites">color picking websites</a> and
              also read the <a href="#hsb-color-model">HSB color model</a>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              then make a gradient from the main and the secondary color (in
              case you need it)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              then you choose your text color which the instructor in
              <a href="https://youtu.be/B-ytMSuwbf8?si=OqdrZ6KYFZehuMwi">
                envato tuts+ course
              </a>
              called the greys as he made a main black color and made different
              shades of it but the text color doesn't have to be black (in case
              of dark theme the text is a light color)
            </p>
            <p>
              as for the black shades the instructor prefers to make a black
              from his primary color
            </p>
            <img src="images/primary-black.png" alt="" />
            <p class="bg-danger-color">
              and don't use pure black (or white probably) as it provides too
              much contrast for the eye
            </p>
            <p>
              or you can put a black overlay over your primary color and reduce
              the overlay opacity until you get a good tone
            </p>
            <p>
              then he made the different shades by reducing it's opacity to 75%,
              50%, 25%, 10%, 5%
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              then choose an error message (in case you have elements like
              forms) which should be a complemntary redish color to your primary
              one
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              after choosing your colors don't forget to check on the contrast
              you can use figma plugins like <span class="cb">contrast</span> or
              <span class="cb">stark</span>
            </p>

              the very top bar which has (color wheel, extract theme, extract

          <h3 class="main-heading">HSB color model</h3>
          <p>it stands for hue saturation brightness</p>
          <p>
            hue is basically the color itself then saturation is how vibrant
            (pure) or dull (greyish) the color is and birghtness is how bright
            (whitish) or dim (blackish) the color is
          </p>
          <p>
            hue varies from 0 to 360 with every number preseneting a different
            color
          </p>
          <p>where brightness and saturation vary from 0 to 100</p>
          <p>
            so by varying the saturation you are changin the place of the color
            point in the color picker horizontally, meaning that a 50 saturation
            and 100 brightness will but the point exactly at the middle top of
            the picker
          </p>
          <img src="images/ui-ux-HSB-50-sat.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            where a 50 saturation with 50 brightness will put in the center of
            the picker

          <h3>typography</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              envato tuts course didn't put specific steps to detect the right
              font
            </p>
            <p>
              basically you have to understand the brand and it's end users (and
              in my opinion see a lot of websites in the field you're designing
              for)
            </p>
            <p>
              for example luxurious brands use
              <span class="cb">serif</span> fonts, and tech brands use
              <span class="cb">sans serif</span> fonts to give a feeling of
              modern and trust
            </p>
            <p>
              the following is from my experience: as a rule of thumb you
              shouldn't use more than 2 font families in your website as more
              than that affects the performance and consistency of the website
            </p>
            <p>
              after choosing your fonts you set the rule of each font: which
              gonna be used for headings, which gonna be used for paragraphs,
              etc...
            </p>
            <p>
              finally don't forget to check for it's readability (by reducing
              it's font size down to the smalles value you will be using and see
              how it does)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              now after choosing your fonts you choose their attributes
              (weights, fontsizes, scale for the headings, line heights)
            </p>
            <p>
              as for the base font size envato tuts instructor chose 21
              explaining that it's a bit larger than usual but that what suits
              the exact design he was working on in the course and didn't say
              exact steps on how to choose the base so I made my research
            </p>
            <p>
              according to
              <a
                href="https://www.learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html"
              >
                learn ui
              </a>
              web pages can be categorized into two categories based on the text
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                text-heavy pages: basically any page you keep reading in like
                (documentations and articles) the main function of the page for
                you is to read
                <p>examples: medium.com or tailwind documentation</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                interaction-heavy pages: apps that require alot of clicking,
                searching and looking for items
                <p>examples: facebook, and instagram</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              so the general rule is to
              <span class="cb">never go less than 16px</span> one reason for
              that is inputs with 16px ios browsers will automatically zoom in
              on the left side of them making having to zoom out manually to
              conintue browsing normally creating an awful user experience in my
              opinion
            </p>
            <p>
              one exception for that rule is when the text is "less important"
              like a comment on a sentence you can make it 14px or 15px (iphone
              use 17px base and 15px less important)
            </p>
            <p>
              so when it comes to <span class="cb">text-heavy</span> web pages
              it's good to use a bigger font size than 16px something like 18px
              or even 20px (medium.com عمنا وعم المجال uses 20px )
            </p>
            <img src="images/ios-input-zoom.gif" alt="" />
            <p>
              as for <span class="cb">interaction-heavy</span> web pages 16px is
              a very good spot (facebook uses 15px, and insta uses 14px)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            according to
            <a
              href="https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/how-to-choose-the-right-font-sizes-85eea2023e9b"
            >
              medium
            </a>
            for desktop (1440 x 1024 px down to 1024 x 768 px) text-heavy pages
            <img src="images/desktop-text-heavy-font-size.png" alt="" />
            as for desktop interaction-heavy pages
            <img src="images/desktop-interaction-heavy-font-size.png" alt="" />
            <img src="images/iphone-default-font-sizes.png" alt="" />

            <img src="images/android-font-sizes.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            after choosing your base fontsize go to
            <a href="https://typescale.com/"> typescale.com </a> or
            <a href="https://archetypeapp.com/"> archetypeapp.com/ </a>
            to get your headings fontsizes based on your base fontsize and the
            scale you prefere
          </div>
          <p>
            finally when you're all done with the fontsizes add them as styles
            in figma

            said he uses the <span class="cb">8pt system</span> which means all
            his measurments can be devided by 8 which is the same principle
            <span class="cb">tailwind css</span> based its measures on

          <p>
            he also said there were more technincal reasons in a medium article
            (he didn't leave the link) so give the article a read as it's

          <h3>icons</h3>
          <p>
            according to
            <a href="https://youtu.be/B-ytMSuwbf8?si=kDY6RkYvQEM1LWb0">
              envato tuts
            </a>
            icons don't have to be from the same iconset but they should have
            the same style (all outlines or all solid, etc...)
          </p>
          <p>
            below are couple of iconsets that the instructor in envato tuts uses
            regularly (I won't include super popular ones like fontawesome and
            boxicons, ets..)
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap icons</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://heroicons.com/">hero icons</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons">ion icons</a></li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://icons.theforgesmith.com/">forge icons</a> (I
              noticed it has really nice outline icons so keep it in mind)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            he also mentioned a program that helps you to organize different
            icon sets on your pc called
            <a href="https://iconset.io/"> iconset </a>

          <h3>images</h3>
          <p>
            the instructor in

              envato tuts
            </a>
            explained that he preferes to avoid stock images as much as he can
            and instead asks the business owners for real images as he like to
            be as genuine as he can but that doesn't mean that stock images are
            an absolute no they're just the second option

          <h3>commone patterns</h3>
          <p>
            the next sections will be about common patterns of different parts
            of a webpage like (headers, hero sections, cards, etc...)
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>common patterns for headers</h4>
            <p>
              so according to
              <a href="https://youtu.be/B-ytMSuwbf8?si=eTggNPRbmptGGgqs"
                >envato tuts</a
              >
              instructor the general definition of a header is: an area at the
              top of the webpage that contains
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>logo</li>
              <li>navigation</li>
              <li>call to action (cta)</li>
              <li>and a search form</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              while not all four should be present in the header but at least it
              should contain the logo and the navigation to be called header
            </p>
            <p>
              the previous definition is not a standard (at least from what I
              understand I didn't do my homework yet) but more like an implicit
              opinion as some people will consider the hero section part of the
              header
            </p>
            <p>
              some headers are simple like
              <a href="https://stripe.com/">stripe</a>
            </p>
            <img src="images/ui-ux-stripe-header.png" alt="" />
            <p>logo, navigation, and call to action</p>
            <p>while others are a bit complex like adidas</p>
            <img src="images/ui-ux-adidas-header.png" alt="" />
            <p>where you can find</p>
            <ul>
              <li>promotion bar with the latest offers</li>
              <li>seconadry navigation</li>
              <li>
                primary navigation with logo,nav, search form,and some conttorls
                like the saved favorites and the cart
              </li>

              let's say you have a button with the main color and you want to

            </p>
            <p>
              you break the link by clicking the broken chain loop beside the

            <ul>
              <li>when making an animated element like a spiner</li>
              <li>
                when making an interacting element like button with hover state
              </li>
              <li>
                when repeating the same element with changes like pricing cards
                or navbar links
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>compenets with repeated elements</h4>
            <p>
              it's really important espicially with something like navbar links
              so when you need to make a change like the color or the casing of
              the letters you just change the parent component and all of them
              change instead of you going for one by one (just like classes in
              css)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>how to make a component and varient</h4>
            <p>
              lets say we're making a navbar element. You want to make three
              states
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>the active state (usually home)</li>
              <li>the default one</li>
              <li>and the hover state</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/figma-component-and-varients.png" alt="" />
            <ul class="big-items">
              <li>
                <p>
                  the <span class="second-color">the best practice</span> that
                  you make a seperate component page
                </p>
                <p>
                  to make a new page click on the "page-1" on the right side of
                  left bar
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-pages.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  here I renamed it to "final design" but in default it says
                  "page-1"
                </p>
                <p>
                  once you click on it, it will open a list of all the pages you
                  have click the plus icon to add a page (figma allows 3 pages
                  per project in the free plan)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                go to your component page, choose the type tool either from the
                top bar or by hitting "t" on the keyboard, then type the first
                navbar link you want which is usually "home"
              </li>
              <li>
                select that element and from the top bar hit the diamond-like
                icon
                <img src="images/figma-make-component-icon.png" alt="" />
              </li>
              <li>
                name your component from the right bar under
                <span class="cb">current varient</span>
                <img src="images/figma-component-naming.png" alt="" />
              </li>
              <li>
                make varient by selecting the component then in the place of the
                diamond-like icon you will find a plus icon looks like it when
                you click that it makes you a new varient, make the changes you
                want
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  then to make the hover state make a third varient with the
                  changes you like then from the right open the
                  <span class="cb">prototype</span>
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-prototype.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  hit the plus icon from the
                  <span class="cb">on click</span> dropdown choose
                  <span class="cb">while hovering</span> then hover over the
                  default state varient, a small plus icon will show up drag
                  from the icon then connect to the last varient which is the
                  hover state
                </p>
                <img src="images/figma-smart-animation.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  from the <span class="cb">instant</span> dropdown menu choose
                  smart animation
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  now to use the component in the design go to the main design
                  page from the left bar choose <span class="cb">assests</span>

                  note that in that crash course the instructor made the changes

                  the only way or there's a way to make changes just once and it

        <!-- auto layout -->
        <section>
          <h3>auto layout</h3>
          <p>
            one of the most important features to use in figma (one of the
            reasons why the figma to webflow plugin requires the design to be
            auto layout)
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>how to put elements in auto layout</h4>
            <p>
              after selecting the elements you eihter hit
              <span class="cb">shift + a</span> or from the right bar
            </p>
            <img src="images/figma-auto-layout.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>order</h4>
            <img src="images/figma-auto-layout-order-1.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              let's say you have images in an auto layout like the above image
              and you want the images stacked such as the left one is on top
              instead of the right one
            </p>
            <img src="images/figma-auto-layout-order-2.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              open the advanced options of the auto layout then on the right of
              <span class="cb">canvas stacking</span> and choose first at top
              instead of last at top
            </p>
            <img src="images/figma-auto-layout-reverse-order.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>text baseline alignment</h4>
            <p>
              sometimes when you align text with an icon the alignment is a bit
              off (even if you make sure they're centered)
            </p>
            <img src="images/figma-text-baseline-alignment-1.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              to solve this go to the advanced settings in autolayout and click
              on the check mark next to
              <span class="cb">align text baseline</span>
            </p>
            <img src="images/figma-text-baseline-alignment-2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>padding and spacing</h4>
            <p>
              when you hover on the edges of the autolayout a pink handle
              appears (for the padding) or when you hover between the items (for
              the spacing)
            </p>
            <img src="images/figma-auto-layout-padding.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              you can either drag the handle and change the padidng or the
              spacing or you can click it and enter a specific number
            </p>
            <p>
              if you want to change the padding on all directions at one time
              hold <span class="cb">shift + alt</span> while dragging or
              clicking the padding handle
            </p>
            <p>
              or you can enter the padding values from the right bar, you will
              find the top&bottom value and the left&right value if you want to
              enter different value (for top different than bottom for exmple)
              you can either click the icon on their right and it will show you
              4 values value for each side or you can enter you values seprated
              by commas like css (12, 14 for example)
            </p>
            <p>
              if you want to enter a specific value for all side from the right
              bar hold <span class="cb">ctrl</span> and click on any value and
              enter the value you want
            </p>
            <p>
              or you can enter four values separated by commas when you hold
              <span class="cb">ctrl</span> and click any of the values
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>absolute postion</h4>
            <img src="images/figma-absolute-position.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              sometimes you want to relate some items to the frame without
              reserving a space for them in the layout (just like in the css)
              like in the image above you want the star to be at the top right
              corner of the button no matter what it size is
            </p>
            <div class="img-container">
              <img src="images/figma-absolute-position-example-1.png" alt="" />
              <img src="images/figma-absolute-position-example-2.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
              another exmple is in the above image which shows the left
              indicator relates to the height of the text height without taking
              up space it's in

              <li>
                select the item then click the absolute position icon on the

            to toggle between <span class="cb">packed</span> and
            <span class="cb">spaced</span> mode in distributing auto layout you
            can either click the spacing box and hit
            <span class="cb">x</span> on your keyboard or you can click the
            small arrow on the right of the gap number and choose
            <span class="cb">auto</span>

            <p>
              by default bordes are not included in the auto layout sizing to
              change that go to the advanced settings of the auto layout by
              clicking the three dots icon on the right in the auto layout panel
              in the right bar and next to
              <span class="cb">strokes</span> choose include from the dropdown
              menu
