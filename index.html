              <h3>why to add them</h3>
              <p>
                If you don't set the width and height attributes the browser
                will wait unitl the image is loaded to calculate the dimentions
                of the image and then make a space for it and
                <b>it's bad for two reasons: </b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  layout shift: the text being suddenly pushed down when the
                  image is loaded which is really annoying
                </li>
                <li>
                  increasing the loading time and decreasing the performance of
                  the page as the browser has to calculate the dimentions itself
                </li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h3>what happens when you add them ?</h3>
              <p>
                the browser takes the width and the height and put them in an
                <b>aspect-ratio</b> in the user agent so it makes a space for
                the image without the need of waiting it to download.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>note:</b> when you set when dimention with css (width or
                height) you should make sure you set the other dimention (height
                or width) to <span class="code-btn">auto</span>.Otherwise the
                value will still be taken the attriubte you specified before.
                <b>when you set the other dimention to auto: </b> the browser
                calculates it based on the aspect ratio it has (from the width
                and the height attributes) without the need of waiting the image
                to download
              </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    the implementation of the browser detecting the aspect-ratio
                    based on the width and the height attriubtes is still new
                    (around 2020). <br />
                    the aspect-ratio css proprety for images itself is still new
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    for responsive images like the code below
                    <img src="images/responsive-img-codesnippt.png" alt="" />
                    you can only set width and height attribute to the main
                    image and you can't set them to the images in srcset. <br />
                    the best solution so far is to make sure that all of them
                    have the same aspect-ratio
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    it doesn't work width <b>art direction</b> read about it if
                    you want I want brief it here as it's not relavent to me at
                    this time

                    <b>ads: </b>
                    During the ad lifecycle, many points can introduce layout
                    shift:
                    <ul>
                      <li>When a site inserts the ad container in the DOM</li>
                      <li>
                        When a site resizes the ad container with first-party
                        code
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the ad tag library loads (and resizes the ad
                        container)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        When the ad fills a container (and resizes if the final
                        ad has a different size)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    and the best solution introduced by web.dev is to
                    pre-reserve a space to the ad by setting dimetinos for an ad
                    container
                    <b
                      >and make sure it is in the page wheather the ad is loaded
                      or not to avoid layout shift when the ad fails to load</b
                    >. <br />
                    This solution can have some downsides like the ad being
                    smaller than the container you made which leades to blank
                    spaces.

          <h3>What are void elements in HTML?</h3>
          <p>
            HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be
            closed are Void elements. For Example &lt;br /&gt;, &lt;img /&gt;,

          <h3>What is the advantage of collapsing white space?</h3>
          <p>
            In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a
            single space character, Because the browser collapses multiple
            spaces into a single space character and this helps a developer to
            indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces and
            maintain readability and understandability of HTML codes

          <h3>What are HTML Entities?</h3>
          <p>
            In HTML some characters are reserved like &lt;, &gt; , '/', etc. To
            use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character
            entities called HTML Entities. Below are a few mapping between the
            reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

            so lets say you have a language emmet doesn't know like
            <span class="cb">.razor</span> but it's actually html you type
            "razor": "html"
          </p>
          <p>
            you could also add language to emmet from the settings interface

          <h3>decimal point in a class error</h3>
          <p>
            appearantly pugjs has problem with the decimal point in some of
            tailwind css classes
          </p>
          <img src="images/pug-decimal-point.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            a quick solution a came up with is using the
            <span class="cb">(class='')</span> syntax to add the classes with
            decimal point

          <h3>lesson-6: includes</h3>
          <p>
            includes can be useful with the components that are repeated in
            every page of the website like the navbar and footer
          </p>
          <p>to include a navbar in your page:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              make a pug file (navbar.pug) and put the structure you want in it
            </li>
            <li>
              in the place you want to deploy the navbar at type
              <span class="cb">include</span> followed by space then the
              relative path of your navbar pug file
              <img src="images/pug-includes.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                notice that you don't need to type
                <span class="cb">.pug</span> incase of including pug files
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- lesson 7 -->
        <section class="pug-extend">
          <h3>Lesson 7 - Extends and blocks</h3>
          <p>
            while <span class="cb">include</span> is used with the static
            content that is repeated <span class="cb">extend</span> is used for
            dynamic repeated content like:
          </p>
          <p>every html page of your website have the same structure</p>
          <ol>
            <li>head with the same links and google fonts</li>
            <li>
              body with header, main(and that one is different in every page),
              and footer
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            so instead of coping and pasting all that structure among the pages
            only to change the main section of every page you can store the
            structure in a pug file, <span class="cb">extend</span> it, and
            override the main section
          </p>
          <p>steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>make a pug file (structure.pug)</li>
            <li>
              for the basic stuff like the links in the html starter code (the
              meta tags, etc...) and the links we paste it as is
              <img src="images/pug-extend-head.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              as for the main three parts we mentioned in the example above (the
              navbar or header, the main, and the footer) we use
              <span class="cb">block</span> before each one to let pug konw that
              they're modifiable
              <img src="images/pug-extend-body.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                notice that the paths in the layout pug file are relative to it
                not to the file it will be extended in
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                also notice that the names after the
                <span class="cb">block</span> keyword are not necessarily the
                html element names (the element names are below the block
                statement line)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              now you can go to any page of your website and delete every thing
              in it and have only <span class="cb">extened</span> followed by
              space then the path of the layout pug file
              <img src="images/pug-extend.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              now to override the default layout we've created to add the
              content of the page in the main section we type
              <span class="cb">block</span> followed by space then the name we
              specified to the main (which was main too), hit enter, hit tab,
              then put the content you want
              <img src="images/pug-extend-override.png" alt="" />
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            notice that according to the instructor of the course "you can only
            have one extend line the page because it provides the structure of
            page and each page can have only one structure"
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            also notice that the extend line must be the first line of the file

          <h3>Lesson-8: JavaScript in Pug: Variables</h3>
          <p>to declair a variable:</p>
          <p>
            type dash (-) followed by space then let or const, the variable name
            <span class="cb">- let myFirstVar = 'hola'</span>
          </p>
          <p>how to use the variable in pug:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              using <span class="cb">#{the variable}</span> like p #{myFirstVar}
              which yields in => &lt;p&gt;hola&lt;p&gt;
            </li>
            <li>
              using the (=) sign immediately after html element then the
              variable name <span class="cb">p= myFirstVar</span> which yeilds
              in => &lt;p&gt;hola&lt;p&gt;

                notice that it's a must not to have any spaces between the html
                element and the equal sign for the code to run as wanted
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              you can use variables in template literatures just like in

            the instructor illustrated that not all the time we will be watching
            only one pug file and in case of multiple file we will need to stop
            the watch on one file then switch to the other and this of course a

          </p>

            I didn't feel like watching steps I don't understand a thing of so I
            didn't continue watching the video but maybe I come back later after
