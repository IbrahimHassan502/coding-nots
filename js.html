        <ul class="big-items">
          <li>
            <span class="second-color">DOM</span> and all of its objects like
            window are not in the core JS just like console they are
            <em>web APIs</em> or <em>host objects</em> provided by the browser
            engine for the language to manipulate.
          </li>

          <li>
            each browser has it's own JS engine or interpreter understands and
            executes the language.
            <ul>
              <li>Google has: <b>v8</b> engine</li>
              <li>FireFox has: <b>spider</b> monkey engine</li>
              <li>Edge has: <b>chakra</b> engine</li>
            </ul>
            And just like humans each engine differes in how it understand the
            language and how fast it understands.So not all new features are
            immediately implemented.
            <p>
              So preformance of JS depends on the host environment which is the
              browser or more specifically the engine which compiles the codes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="cb">array.push();</span> returns the new length of the
            array.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="cb">array.pop();</span> returns the removed element
            from the array.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="cb">array[-1]</span> doesn't return the last element in
            the array
            <p>
              in order to get the last element you either use
              <span class="cb">array[array.length-1]</span>
            </p>
            <p>or just use <span class="cb">array.at(-1)</span></p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="cb">.getElementsByClassName();</span> and
            <span class="cb">.getElementsByByTagName();</span>
            <b>they don't return an array</b> but they return an array-like
            called <span class="second-color">HTML collectoin</span>.
            <p>
              While <span class="cb">.querySelector();</span> returns
              <span class="second-color">Node list</span>
              <b>
                which you can't itterate over using
                <span class="cb">.map()</span>
              </b>
              method but you can itterate over it by
              <span class="cb">.forEach()</span> but it's not well supported
              (according to FWD). So you can use
              <span class="code-b">for..of loop</span> or you can just use a
              basic <span class="cb">for loop</span>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            the image below demonstrates how
            <span class="second-color">JS is parsed</span> the browser after
            recieving the code from the server.
            <img src="images/js-parse.png" alt="" />
          </li>

          <li>
            <span class="cb">.getElementsByClassName();</span> both document and
            elements has this mehtod in their
            <span class="second-color">interface</span> (and both inherit from
            the Node interface).
            <p>
              interface is the Class or the blueprint (that has all the
              properites and the methods (functionality of the object)) while
              whatever made out of that class is called object.
            </p>
            So document and elements both have the
            <span class="cb">.getElementsByClassName();</span> method means if
            you call the mehod on an element you get the sub-elements (the
            children elements) by the class you called.
            <img src="images/sub-elements-js.png" alt="" />
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>.textContent VS .innerText</h3>
            <p>
              <b class="second-color">textContent: </b> returns the text of the
              element (and it's decendents) as it is in the HTML (regradless of
              the css).
            </p>
            <p>
              <b class="cb">innerText: </b> returns the text as it will be seen
              <b>visually</b> meaning it consideration.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              the difference between the 2 of them appeared when I need to match
              a capitalized text with an all-small-case text using
              <span class="cb">.innerText()</span> method and kept giving me
              errors
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              if you have an element with an id (say the id is "hello"), you can
              access the element by the id
              <span class="second-color">without declaration</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              meaning if you directly write console.log(hello), it will return
              the element in the console.
              <span class="bg-second-color">
                as long as you don't have variable with the same name in your

          <li>
            in javascript there are two ways to write a

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span class="cb">new Date(2021, 1, 25)</span>: here the month is
                februry (number 1 not 2) as in this case month numbers start
                from 0 to 11.
                <div class="bg-second-color">
                  <p>
                    if type 12 in the month it will be janurary from the nex
                    year
                  </p>
                  <p>Date(1990, 12, 1) will return January 1st, 1991</p>
                </div>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="cb">new Date('2021-1-25')</span>: here the month is
                janurary (same number as written) as in this case the month
                numbers start from 1 to 12 like normal.

          <li>
            <span class="cb">.insertAdjacentHTML(place, text)</span> lets you
            add text or (elements) in the place you specify as the first
            argument. place can be one the folloing four places:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="code-b">beforebegin</span>

            <p class="bg-second-color">
              The output is true and false. Here is the explanation, In
              Javascript relational operators are evaluated from left to right,
              false equals 0, and true equals 1 for number comparisons. So
              comparison evaluation is something like this,

            <h3>++i VS i + 1</h3>
            <p>
              in the code you may want to change how the i is showed in the code
              so you want when the i is 0 it is showed as 1
            </p>
            <p>
              in case of <span class="second-color">++i</span>: it changes the
              <span class="second-color">actual</span>value of the i so you will
              notice it's skipping a value each iteration
            </p>
            <p>
              but in case of <span class="second-co">i + 1</span>: you're simply
              using the value of i and adding 1 to it
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            you can add animation (keyframes) by js by using
            <span class="cb">
              element.animate([{keyframe1}, {keyframe2}, ....], {options})
            </span>
            <img src="images/animate.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              in options you can set all the animation options you use in css
              like (animation-duration, animation-delay,
              animation-iteration-count, animation-direction,
              animation-timing-function, animation-fill-mode)
            </p>
            <p>
              but names of the properties maybe different for example
              animation-duration is duration and animtaion-fill-mode is fill
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>get element's parent multiple levels up the DOM tree</h3>
            <p>
              use the <span class="cb">.closest()</span> method with a vail css
              selector between the parentheses
            </p>
            <img src="images/closest-method-example.png" alt="" />
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>onChange on the parent</h3>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              I figured out that you can apply
              <span class="cb">addEventListner('change', () => {})</span>
              on the parent of the input you want to monitor instead of the
              input itself
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              this is useful in the case in the image down below. At first I
              made a forEach loop that assigns an eventlistener for each input
              instead of applying it on the parent

    <!-- ======== JavaScript runtime starts ========  -->
    <article>
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="main-heading">A JavaScript runtime</h2>
        <h3>Synonyms: Host environment</h3>
        <p>
          The environment in which the JavaScript code runs and is interpreted
          by a JavaScript engine.The runtime provides the host objects that
          JavaScript can operate on and work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          The JavaScript runtime is the “existing entity or system” mentioned in
          the scripting language definition. Code passes through the JavaScript
          engine, and once parsed and understood, an entity or system performs
          the interpreted actions. A dog walks, a person runs, a video game
          character jumps or in the case of the above image, wrecks.
          Applications make themselves available to JavaScript scripting by
          providing “host objects” at runtime. For the client side, the
          JavaScript runtime would be the web browser, where host objects like
          windows and HTML documents are made available for manipulation. Have
          you ever worked with the window or document host objects? The window
          and document objects are not actually a part of the core JavaScript
          language. They are Web APIs, objects provided by a browser acting as
          JavaScript's host environment. For the server side, the JavaScript
          runtime is Node.js. Server-related host objects such as the file
          system, processes, and requests are provided in Node.js. An
          interesting point: different JavaScript runtimes can share the same
          JavaScript engine. V8, for example, is the JavaScript engine used in
          both Google Chrome and Node.js — two very different environments.
        </p>

    <!-- ======== JavaScript runtime ends ========  -->

    <!-- ======== hoisting starts ========  -->
    <article>
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="main-heading">hoisting</h2>
        <p>
          hoisting means putting something up and in code it means putting a
          piece of code in the begging of the script
        </p>
        <p>
          hoisting can be observed in JS when calling a <b>function</b> before
          declargin it what happen is that when JS is interpreted all function
          and variables declration are hoisted to the top of the code so the
          interpreter now knows the function you called before declaring it.
        </p>
        <p>
          with variable hoisting there is a trick
          <b>only the declration is hoisted</b> not the assignment so if you
          write <span class="cb">var x = 5;</span> what is actually hoisted is
          <span class="code-b">var x;</span> and the assignment
          <span class="cb">x = 5;</span> stayes where it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>keep that in mind when assigning a function to a variavle</b>
        </p>
      </div>
    </article>
    <!-- ======== hoisting ends ========  -->

    <!-- ======== similar functions but different starts ========  -->
    <article>
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="main-heading">same name same job but not same function</h2>

        <p>
          if you declare a function with somename say (myFun) and made do
          something say(console.log('hola');) and then made another function
          with the exatct same name and the same job they are not actually the
          same function.
        </p>

        <p>
          analogy to help you understand this is housed you can have two similar
          houses with even the same furniture but they don't have the same
          address and they simply not the same house.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b class="second-color">why is this usuful to know?</b>
        </p>
        <p>it's usuful in the case shown in the image below.</p>
        <img src="images/200-functoins.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          this code makes 200 hunderd <em>differen</em> functions that basically
          do the same thing.
        </p>
        <img src="images/200-functions-illustration.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          so the best practice is to actually use the same function like shown
          in the image below.
        </p>
        <img src="images/function-bestPractice.png" alt="" />
        <img src="images/function-bestPractice-illustratoin.png" alt="" />

        <p class="bg-second-color">
          or even better is to set the eventlistenr on the parent as after you
          made it the same function there still a 200 eventlistenr.
        </p>
        <img src="images/more-function-besPracitce.jpg" alt="" />
        <p class="bg-second-color">
          <b>note:</b> same thing goes with objects having the same properites
          with the same value doesn't meant they are the same thing.

              Take away the difficulty of compiling and linking.
              <p>
                Since scripting languages are interpreted and not compiled they
                don't have the issue of compiling and then linking the source
                code.

              Most of the network administrators know how to write scripts.
              <p>
                Since the script can be easy to learn, most of the network
                administrators know how to write scripts.

              Being a client-side can reduce the demand on the webserver.
              <p>
                Since scripts can be both client and server-side, they can be
                helpful in their respective places. If scripts are client-side
                they can help in reducing the server demand since all the
                processing is done on the client machine.

          Both Interpreter and Compiler convert source code into machine code.

          code when the program is run.

          total blocking time (TBT) & first input delay (FID)
        </h3>
        <section>
          <h3>FID</h3>
          <p>
            when the broswer is loading the page and the user takes an action
            that's the first input but since the browser is loading the page so
            it may be doing a <span class="second-color">task</span> and tasks
            can't be interrupter so the browser ignores the user utnil it
            finishes the task then do the action the uesr wants and this is
            first input delay.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>TBT</h3>
          <p>
            since FID is depenedant on the user like you and myself so it's
            almost unmeasured since I may decide to take different action in
            different time (during the loading) than you.
          </p>
          <p>
            so they decided instead that the standard (maximum) delay is
            <span class="second-color">50ms</span> and any task takes more time
            than this, this time (time after 50ms) is called
            <span class="second-color">blocking time</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            so total blokcing time is the sum of the blocking time from all the
            tasks in the page like shown in the image below.
          </p>
          <img src="images/TBT-tasks.svg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/TBT-blockingTime.svg" alt="" />
          <img src="images/TBT-timeTable.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            so in technical speeking TBT doesn't measure FID as it's likely not
            possible to measure it, but instead if you decrease the TBT it
            decreases the possibility of big FID happening.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>decrease TBT</h3>
          <p>
            well... couple of methods and tehcnique were mentioned like
            <span class="second-color">minifying</span> css and JS and other

            serever delay and stuff like that) so I didn't just copy past
            something I don't fully understand and probably won't even remember.

        <p>
          at the begning you should know that those two matter only when you put
          your <span class="cb">script tag</span> in the
          <span class="cb">head</span>
        </p>
        <h3>in the normal situation:</h3>
        <p>
          the parser goes on your code and parse it line by line when it goes to
          the script tag in the head it parses all the javascript and excute it
          before it continues parsing the html in what is called
          <span class="second-color">parser-blocking javascript</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          the image below will illustrate the difference in the behaviour
          between normal script tag and with async attribute and with defer
          attribute.
          <span class="bg-second-color">
            all three the script tag is in the head
          </span>
        </p>
        <img src="images/async-defer.png" alt="" />
        <h3>in both cases</h3>
        <p>
          in both cases the javascript file is downloaded parallel with the html
          parsing elemenating parser-blocking javascript.
        </p>
        <h3>async:</h3>
        <p>
          in case of async the javascript is excuted as soon as it is available
          which means sometimes it can be excuted before the parsing is complete
          which blocks it. and some other times it will be excuted after the
          parsing is complete depending on how fast your internet connection
        </p>
        <h3>defer:</h3>
        <p>
          in defer case the javascript is
          <span class="second-color">always</span> excuted after the html is
          parsed and before the document is done which fires the
          <span class="cb">DOMContentLoaded</span> event.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="bg-second-color">
          The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the initial HTML document has
          been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets,

            normally when you click in the orange div which has class "three"

          <p>that's because event goes through 2 phases</p>
          <h3>capturing</h3>
          <p>
            in which the event is detecting the element you clicked on so in
            this case it caputres
            <span class="cb">&lt;html&gt;</span> then
            <span class="cb">&lt;body&gt;</span> then

          </p>
          <p>
            now your element is detected then the event goes through the second
            phase
          </p>
          <h3>bubbling</h3>
          <p>
            in this phase the event (which in this is case is "click") is fired
            from the clicked element up meaning it fires on div "three" then on
            div "two" then on div "one" since you "technically" clicked on them
            since your element is a child in them.
          </p>
          <p>

        <div>
          this is the normal behaviour of events in javascript but you can
          control it by either
          <ul>
            <li>reverse the behaviour</li>

          </ul>

        <div>
          <h3>reverse bubbling and turning it into captureing</h3>
          <p>
            simply the syntax of
            <span class="cb">.addEventListner()</span> method is
          </p>
          <p class="cb">
            element.addEventListener(event, listener, useCapture);
          </p>
          <p>
            and normally capture is set to be false
            <span class="cb">
              element.addEventListener(event, listener,
              <span class="bg-second-color">{capture: false}</span> );
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            so if you set <span class="cb">capture: true</span> the console log

          <p>

            two <br />
            three

          <p class="bg-second-color">

          <p>
            The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns
            the value of the last operand. This operator is primarily used
            inside a for loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each
            time through the loop. It is regarded bad style to use it elsewhere,
            when it is not necessary. Often two separate statements can and
            should be used instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if a is a 2-dimensional array with 10 elements on a
            side, the following code uses the comma operator to update two
            variables at once. The code prints the values of the diagonal
            elements in the array:

        <p>
          if you have function that have two level of function nesting in it
          like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/curry-function1.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          now these are three functions each one needs an argument. If you try
          to pass the arguments like this =>
          <span class="cb">takeNmae('ibrahim', 'mohamed', 'ali')</span>
          this would be passing three arguments to the first function. (it will
          take the frist one as firstName and the other two will be ignored)
        </p>
        <p>
          so the right syntax would be like this =>
          <span class="cb">takeName('ibrahim')('mohamed')('ali)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          now for more advanced quick syntax you can change it into arrow
          function something like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/curry-function2.png" alt="" />
        <p>offcourse you can remove the parentheses</p>
        <p>
          you also can use curry functoins on more than one stage like this:
        </p>
        <img src="images/curry-function3.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          notice if just logged myName without the last argument =>

        </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  First, strict mode makes it impossible to accidentally create
                  global variables. In normal JavaScript mistyping a variable in
                  an assignment creates a new property on the global object
                  (adding the mistyped variable as a property to the window
                  object) and continues to "work" (although future failure is
                  possible: likely, in modern JavaScript). Assignments, which
                  would accidentally create global variables, instead throw an
                  error in strict mode:
                  <img src="images/use-strict-mistyped-variable.png" alt="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                  Second, strict mode makes assignments which would otherwise
                  silently fail to throw an exception.
                  <p>silent fail assignments:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      assignment to a non-writable global or property. like
                      assigning to
                      <span class="cb">NaN</span>

                    <li>assignment to a getter-only property</li>
                    <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  third strict mode throws error when attempts to delete

                    fourth unique function arguments: normally if you type 2

                    Fifth, a strict mode in ECMAScript 5 forbids a 0-prefixed
                    octal literal or octal escape sequence. Outside strict mode,
                    a number beginning with a 0, such as 0644, is interpreted as
                    an octal number (0644 === 420), if all digits are smaller
                    than 8. Octal escape sequences, such as "\45", which is
                    equal to "%", can be used to represent characters by
                    extended-ASCII character code numbers in octal. In strict
                    mode, this is a syntax error. In ECMAScript 2015, octal
                    literals are supported by prefixing a number with "0o"; for
                    example:
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="cb">var a = 0o10;</span> => ES2015: Octal</p>
                  <p>
                    Novice developers sometimes believe a leading zero prefix
                    has no semantic meaning, so they might use it as an
                    alignment device — but this changes the number's meaning! A
                    leading zero syntax for the octal is rarely useful and can
                    be mistakenly used, so strict mode makes it a syntax error:
                  </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Sixth, strict mode in ECMAScript 2015 forbids setting
                  properties on primitive values. Without strict mode, setting
                  properties is ignored (no-op), with strict mode, however, a
                  TypeError is thrown.

                If a property with the same name exists on the object's
                prototype chain, then, after deletion, the object will use the
                property from the prototype chain (in other words, delete only
                has an effect on own properties).
              </li>
              <li>
                Any property declared with var cannot be deleted from the global
                scope or from a function's scope. (but properties in the global
                scope wihout using var can be deleted)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    As such, delete cannot delete any functions in the global

                  <li>
                    Functions which are part of an object (apart from the global
                    scope) can be deleted with delete.

                <p>
                  var, let, and const create non-configurable properties that

                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Non-configurable properties cannot be removed. This includes
                properties of built-in objects like Math, Array, Object and
                properties that are created as non-configurable with methods
                like <span class="cb">Object.defineProperty()</span>. (In strict
                mode this will raise a TypeError.)

              </li>
              <li>
                in strict mode: if delete is used on a direct reference to a
                variable, a function argument or a function name, it will throw
                a SyntaxError. Therefore, to avoid syntax errors in strict mode,
                you must use the delete operator in the form of
                <span class="cb">delete object.property</span>
                or <span class="cb">delete object['property']</span>.

                  When you delete an array element, the array length is not

                  you can overcome that

              the only two cases where

              this would be useful when using the

            <p>
              the regular form of the for loop is
              <span class="cb">
                for(initialization;condition;incremen or decrement)
              </span>
              and you know that we can put the initialization statement before
              the loop and the increment statement in the curly braces
            </p>
            <p>
              but what is new in this article is that you can merge the
              condition and the increment statements together
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="cb">
                for(let counter = -1; (arr.length - 1) > counter++;) {do
                something}
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              when you understand the code above you find that the counter in
              the assessment is -1 but in the loop is 0
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              another way to merge the two statements is illustrated in the img
              below
            </p>
            <img src="images/for-loop-merge.png" alt="" />
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice how the value of the 'item' is the condition which can
              cause un-wanted loop break in case of one of the array elements is
              false like (null or undefiend)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              in the loops that doesn't depened on the elements order you can
              use reverse counter like this
            </p>

          <h3>loop performance</h3>
          <p>
            the first and most important things to know is that all for loop
            types are the same performance except for the
            <span class="cb">for...in</span> loop as it does a property lookup
            (search for a property like array.length) each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            which brings us to another important point which is property lookup
            <span class="cb">don't</span> code you loops like this
            <span class="cb">for(let i=0;i&lt;arr.length;i++){}</span> any more
          </p>
          <p>
            instead you store the array.length in a variable then use it
            <span class="cb">let length = arr.length</span> <br />
            <span class="cb">
              for(let counter = 0;counter &lt; length; counter++){}
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>sooo what affectes loop performance ?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>work done per iteration</li>
            <li>number of iterations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            in decreasing the work done per iteration they talked about
            decreasing the property lookups like
            <span class="cb">array.legth</span> and reversing the counter
          </p>
          <p>
            as for decreasing the number of iterations they talked about some
            technique called <span class="second-color">Duff's device</span> I
            didn't really understand a word so i'm not gonna write it in here

            <span class="cb">\</span> to escape a special character and search
            for it literally
          </p>
          <p>
            sometime you may want to search for special charaters (literally)
            that mean something in rgular expressions like the * which means
            zero or more so <span class="cb">/ab*c/</span> means look for an "a"
            followed by zero or more b's then followed by a "c"
          </p>
          <p>
            but <span class="cb">/ab\*c/</span> means look for the exact "ab*c"
            sequence
          </p>
          <p>
            If using the RegExp constructor with a string literal, remember that
            the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the
            regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal
            level. <span class="cb">/a\*b/</span> ===
            <span class="cb">RegExp("a\\*b")</span>

            unary operators and number() are the same they try to change the

            </li>

              you can't but the returned code in another line

              => undefiend
              <p>
                and you will notice the editor will make it like this
                <span class="cb">
                  {return; <br />
                  hi;}

              <p class="cb">
                return ( <br />
                'hi');
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              you can use the
              <span class="cb">return ...; </span> statement to break a loop in
              a function

            notice that the 'interrupting' sentence is not printed in the

          <h3>60 - Function Default Parameters</h3>
          <p>
            to assign default value to the functoin parameter simply add equal
            sign (=) and your defalut value like a normal assignment
          </p>
          <p>
            function sayHello(username,
            <span class="cb">age = "you didn't enter age"</span> ) {
            console.log(`hello ${username} your age is ${age}`) }
          </p>
          <p>
            in this case if the function is called wihtout the age argument the
            the message will be =>
          </p>
          <p>hello osama (for example) your age is you didn't enter age</p>

          <h3>61- Function Rest Parameters</h3>
          <p>
            rest parameter is used when you don't know the numbers of arguments
            that will be sent to the function
          </p>
          <p>rest parameter is simply an array</p>
          <img src="images/rest-parameter.png" alt="" />
          <p>you can use rest parameter with normal parameters like</p>
          <p class="cb">function(param1, param2, ...otherpramas) {}</p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            but you must put the reset parameter as the last one as by logic it
            takes all the arguments sent to it so any other parameter after it
            won't take any
          </p>

            the usual behaviour of function when variables are called (used) is
            that it looks for the varibles inside out
          </p>
          <p>
            meaning that it starts looking in the function scoop if it finds the
            variables it uses their value inside the function (
            <span class="cb">
              even if they have different values outside the function
            </span>
            ). if it doesn't find them it goes to the outer scope, if it doesn't
            find them in that scope, then it goes to the outer scope if there is
            and so on

                acc: is a short for accumulator which is the sum variable where
                you store the value from the previous calculatoin to preform on
                the new value again and so on (offcourse you can call it
                whatever you want)
              </p>
              <p>
                accumulator value in the first itiration is the initial value
                you set. If the initial value is not set (as it's optional) then
                accumulator's value is the first element in the array
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                current: the element that will be calculated with the
                accumulator. in this case the next number that will be added
              </p>
              <p>
                current value in the first itiration is the first element of the
                array if the initial value of the accumulator is set. If the
                initial value is not set then since the accumulator will be the
                first element the current value is the second element
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                index: index of the current element that is to be calculated
                with the accumulator
              </p>
              <p>
                so in the first itiratoin if the initial value is set index = 0
                the first index in the array, if the initial value is not set
                index = 1 the second value of the array
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>arr: is the array being travested through</li>
          </ul>
          <p>of course you can name these parameters any name you want</p>
          <p>index, arr parameters are optional</p>

          <h3>84 - Create Object With Create Method</h3>
          <p>
            as far as I understood the idea of the
            <span class="cb">Object.create(some-object)</span>
            is heritage
          </p>
          <img src="images/object-create-wrong-way.png" alt="" />
          <img src="images/object-create-prototype.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            as you can see the properties and methods of the main object (car)
            is in the prototype of the secondary object (typeA) which means all
            properties and methods of the main object are available to the
            secondary object
          </p>
          <p>
            now you may want to either add another properties (features of the
            car) or methods like
          </p>
          <img src="images/object-create-update-properites.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            but if you notice in the other console.log() the method still
            returns 8 not 6 (2 less doors) why is that ?
          </p>
          <p>
            the mistake that happened here is that in the main object you typed
            <span class="cb"><b>car</b>.doors + car.wheels</span>
            so where ever you call the method it's going to go the car object
            and use it's information
          </p>
          <p>
            the solution for that problem is simply use
            <span class="cb">this</span>
            keywrod
          </p>
          <img src="images/object-create-using-this.png" alt="" />
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            <b>note</b> the O in

          <p>it is used to copy objects to another object</p>
          <p>
            what the code above basically does is that it copies the 3 objects
            into another object
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                if you don't have a target object and you want to copy objects
                into new object you just made. you simply type
                <span class="cb">{}</span> in place of target object
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              also you can add properties while coping other objects
              <p>
                <span class="cb">
                  let newObj = Object.assign({}, obj1, {property1: 'hola',
                  property2: 'hii'})
                </span>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            if you have the same property in more than one object they simply
            overwrite
          </p>
          <img src="images/object-assing-overwrite.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            the last added object had prop1 set to 1 so the final result is 1

          <h3>100 - AddEventListener</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              advantages of <span class="cb">.addEventListner()</span> over
              <span class="cb">.onevent()</span> is that with addEventListener
              you can add more than event while with onevent if you type another
              statement the last one overwrites
            </p>
            <img src="images/multiple-onclick-code.png" alt="" />
            <img src="images/multiple-onclick-result.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <span class="cb">
              element.addEventListner('click', functin() {})
            </span>
            => to add a certain function that gets excuted when the event is
            applied to the element
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              the other advantage elzero explained it with an example. You have
              a paragraph when you click it logs something in the console and
              adds a clone of itself to the body
            </p>
            <p>
              you want the clone to logs another statement in the console when
              it's clicked
            </p>
            <p>
              if you use onevent on the clone it throws error as you didn't
              click the main paragraph yet and thus there is no clone yet. So he
              uses addEventlistner('click', function() {}) on the body and
              checks if the <span class="cb">e.target</span> has a class of
              'cloned' (a class he adds it to the cloned paragraphes) it logs
              that other thing
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              the question here is couldn't he do the same with the onevent
              ?????

          <h3>113 - Session Storage And Use Cases</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              <span class="cb">window.sessionStorage.setItem(key, value)</span>
              => to add item in the session storage object
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="cb">sessionStorage</span> is the same as
              <span class="cb">localStorage</span> but the difference between
              them is that <span class="cb">sessionStorage</span> is cleared
              once the session is ended
            </p>
            <p>what ends a session ?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>closing the whole window</li>
              <li>closing the tab</li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  even if you copy the tab url and opened it in another tab
                  without closing the main one, the new one will have an empty
                  session storage
                </p>
                <p>
                  and the only way to open another tab with the same
                  sessionstorage is you right-click the tab and choose
                  <b>duplicate</b>
                </p>
              </li>

            </p>
            <p>
              so if you set the same property (color for example) to a different

          <div>
            <p>
              to able to add an array to the local storage you add like this
              <span class="cb">
                window.localStorage.setItem("tasks",
                <b>JSON.stringify(myArr)</b>);
              </span>
            </p>
            <p>
              as if you try to add the array the usual way
              <span class="cb">
                window.localStorage.setItem("tasks", myArr)
              </span>
              it will add it as a concatnated string
            </p>
            <p>
              also if you try to retrieve the array as usual
              <span class="cb">window.localStorage.getItem(myArr)</span> it will
              return the array as a string "['..', '..']"
            </p>
            <p>
              so to retrieve the array as an array you type
              <span class="cb">
                JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem(myArr))
              </span>

              another way to add key-values to the map (other than

            is deleted

          <p>same difference between set and weakSet</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              in map you can add any type of data as a key but in the weakMap
              you can only add objects as a key
            </li>
            <li>
              weakMap doesn't have <span class="cb">.size</span> and you can't
              iterate over it since the interpreter can't know for sure the
              items in the weakMap since some of them can be cleaned during the
              garbage collection

            to are replaced so the array length is same)
          </p>
          <p>
            you can use negative values in the start and end indexes but you
            can't use negative values in the index to copy to as it behaves
            weirdly

          <p>
            if start index is neglected it starts from index zero, and if ending
            index is neglected it ends at the end of the array
          </p>
          <p>
            you can't switch the values of the start and ending indexes (you

          <h3>134 - Intro And What Is Regular Expression</h3>
          <p>
            a regular expression enables you to search for a pattern instead of
            a given number or string
          </p>
          <p>
            like if you want to validate an email. As a human you know how email
            general structure looks like: the name (osamaM123) then one @ then
            the domain (gmail or yahoo etc...) then the top level domain (.com
            or .net etc...). So the user can probably enter an email like this:
            myName@@@gmail....com. Trying to account for every thing that makes
            the email not valid is impossible and not a practical solution.
            instead you can validate it as a pattern using the regular
            expressions

          <h3>135 - Regular Expressions - Modifiers</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              myString<span class="cb">.match(regualr expression)</span> => to
              match a string against a regular expression (search for a pattern
              in a string)
            </p>
            <img src="images/regular-expression.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              offcourse you can store the regular expression in a variable and
              put it between the ()
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="cb">let myRegExp = /elzero/;</span> (without
              qoutation marks) <br />
              <span class="cb">console.log(myString.match(myRegExp))</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              as you noticed it returned the second 'elzero' as you typed it
              with 'e' not 'E' so it's case sensitive here comes the
              <span class="second-color">modifier</span> use as the modify the
              searching mechanism
            </p>
            <p><span class="cb">i</span> => to match without case senstivity</p>
            <img src="images/regular-expression-i.png" alt="" />
            <p><span class="cb">g</span> => to return all the matches</p>
            <img src="images/regular-expression-ig.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              notice that you can use more than one flag, also there is no order
              for them (ig === gi)
            </p>
            <p>
              also notice that when the method returned one result only there
              were some additional properties like the index the input you
              searched in and the group name (talking about the group name in
              minute). But when it returned more than one result it didn't
              return the additional properties for each one
            </p>
            <p>
              to return the additional properties for all results use
              <span class="cb">.matchAll()</span> it returns an iterator so you
              gonna use it with <span class="cb">.next()</span>
            </p>
            <img src="images/regular-expression-matchAll.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              but notice that the previous method is slower than
              <span class="cb">.match()</span> which makes sense, sense it
              returns more info
            </p>
            <p>
              as for the group name I don't fully understand it's uses right now
              so the img below will show you what it is

              if the <span class="cb">match()</span> method didn't find what you
              searching for it returns <span class="cb">null</span>
            </p>

              elzero mentioned it but didn't explain it until in the last lesson

          <p>
            sometimes you need to put part of the expression in a parentheses ()
            but this lead for that part to be "remembered" and returned as you
            can notice with the dash "-"
          </p>
          <img src="images/regular-expression-non-group.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            if you need to put part of the expression in a parentheses ()
            without getting captured or remembered (like the first part of the
            expression which matches 3 digits <b>or</b> 3 digits in parentheses)
            use
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="cb">?:</span> => to not remember (capture) the
            expression betewen the parentheses
          </p>
          <img src="images/regular-expression-non-group-notes.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            also as you can notice in image above how capturing can be useful
            (not having to repeat the same expression like in re2)
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            the dollar sign $ in the end makes sure there is no any other thing
            after that expression is accepted as if you remove it and entered
            the space after the numbers it will match like there is nothing
            wrong

          <div>
            <p>
              a constructor function (class) is a function you use to create
              objects based on certain info you want (the constructor is like a
              phone factory and the object is like a phone)
            </p>
            <img src="images/constructor-function.png" alt="" />
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice that the best practice is to type the first letter of the
              constructor function as a capital
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>why use this ?</h4>
            <p>
              you have contorl over all objects made from this function so you
              can alter them easly like if you want to give each of them a 1000
              raise you simply go the
              <span class="cb">this.s = salary</span> and you make it
              <span class="cb">this.s = salary + 1000</span>

            <img src="images/constructor-function-class.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              if you want to check if the object is made from a certain class
              (constructor function) or not you can use either one of the two
              codes below

              if you go in the <span class="cb">constructor(){}</span> and add
              some function like
              <span class="cb">this.msg = function(){}</span> it still is a
              property even if you go in the editor and try to type the object
              name then dot you will see the editor is dealing with this
              function as a property

            <img src="images/oop-property-function.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              notice you need to put the parentheses () so it works. If you
              don't put the parentheses it returns the actual function (when I
              tried it, it threw an error)
            </p>

            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice that it's always recommeneded to use
              <span class="cb">this.</span>property instead of the property
              right away as in other cases these properties can be conditioned
              like this one: if the sent salary is 5000 set this.salary to 5500
              so in that case if you just type
              <span class="cb">${salary}</span> it will use the salary sent to
              the function not the one you set based on condition
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              if you want to set a function in the class to be a method not a
              property you need to set it outside the constructor
            </p>

            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>why use it ?</h4>
            <p>
              one scenario is a website with a user class (constructor that
              makes objects for each user) and you want to make another class
              for admins but both users and admins have mutual properties (say
              id and name for example) and then admins have extra properties
              ("premissions" for example)
            </p>
            <p>
              so you simply make the first class which is users' and then
              inherit it's properties (id and name in this example) and then you
              add the properties you want in the new class (admins in this
              example)
            </p>

            <h4>syntax</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  in the declairation line you add the key word
                  <span class="cb">extends</span> followed by the class you
                  inherit from
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="cb">
                    class myClass <b>extends</b> anotherClass{}
                  </span>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  in the constructor parentheses you type <b>all</b> to
                  properties the made object will have whether they're inherited
                  or not
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  inside the constructor you pick the properties you want to
                  inherit using <span class="cb">super</span>
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  notice you don't just get the properties then you assign it to
                  the objects (like you don't get id then you have to type
                  this.i = id) no you get the property and it's assignment to
                  the object as you can notice in the image above
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  it's like calling the constructor of the parent class as a
                  function with the properites sent to it as an arguments (it
                  takes them and assign them)
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  also notice that you type <b>all</b> the properties you want
                  in the object in the constructor parentheses inherited or not
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  as I mentinod in the inheritance definition you get to choose
                  the properites you want to inherit but you don't choose which
                  methods you inherit them all
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              if you try to inherit properties from a class that already
              inherits from another class you will find the inherited properties
              available for inheritance

          <div>
            <h4>what is it ?</h4>
            <p>encapsulation is when you make an object property private</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>why use it ?</h4>
            <p>
              when you need to process the property before getting the last form
              of it to the object
            </p>
            <p>
              examples like a password: you want to validate some of it before
              it's last form (the form you get you call the object property)
            </p>
            <p>
              or mabye a credit card you want to hide some numbers of it but the
              whole number is still stored in the object
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>syntax</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                first you need to declare the private property before the
                constructor using # <span class="cb">#myProp </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                then you use it like this
                <span class="cb">this.#myProp = sentProp;</span>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              as you can see in the image salary needed some processes to be
              operated before the last form
            </p>
            <p>
              offcourse you can't acces the private property outside the class.
              Code like this
              <span class="cb"> consol.log(user.#salary) </span> will throw an
              error
            </p>

            <h4>notes</h4>
            <p>
              private properties are not accessable outside of the class it's
              declaired in

              <p>
                you may feel wierd using a method to return a property but by
                using <span class="cb">get</span> keyword before the method it
                allows you to call the method without using it's parentheses

                  >MDN</a
                >
                there is some kind of getters (smart getters, and lazy getter)
                and the next paragraphs are copied from there
              </p>
              <p>
                Getters give you a way to define a property of an object, but
                they do not calculate the property's value until it is accessed.
                A getter defers the cost of calculating the value until the
                value is needed. If it is never needed, you never pay the cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                An additional optimization technique to lazify or delay the
                calculation of a property value and cache it for later access
                are smart (or memoized) getters. The value is calculated the
                first time the getter is called, and is then cached so
                subsequent accesses return the cached value without
                recalculating it. This is useful in the following situations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the calculation of a property value is expensive (takes
                  much RAM or CPU time, spawns worker threads, retrieves remote
                  file, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the calculation of a property value is expensive (takes
                  much RAM or CPU time, spawns worker threads, retrieves remote
                  file, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If it's used, it will be accessed several times, and there is
                  no need to re-calculate that value will never be changed or
                  shouldn't be re-calculated.
                </li>
                <li class="bg-second-color">
                  Note: This means that you shouldn't write a lazy getter for a
                  property whose value you expect to change, because if the
                  getter is lazy then it will not recalculate the value. Note
                  that getters are not "lazy" or "memoized" by nature; you must
                  implement this technique if you desire this behavior.

            when you pass a number that is larger than the range (like you pass
            day number 32 and the longst month is 31 days) in this case it will
            make the date day 1 in the next month in case of the month was 31
            days
          </p>
          <p>
            same thing if you pass day 0 or day -1 it will go to the previous

              as far as I understood from elzero and

              it's used to generate numbers (or elements based on numbers). One
              <span class="cb">yield</span> statement is excuted each time it's
              called
            </p>
            <p>qouting from MDN:</p>
            <blockquote class="bg-second-color">

              now you can notice the use of a generator function. If you do the

              notice that using the <span class="cb">next()</span> method
              returns an object containing the value of the next element (in

              notice in case of the array if you remove the star * after the
              yield it will return the array itself and won't iterate over it.
              Same goes to the generators if you remove the * it will return

              Json is more like an indepenent language or mechanism used to
              exchange information and has the structure and conventions most
              languages use so it's valid in most languages
            </p>

              the whole data in the file is wrapped inside curly braces {}

          <p>
            api is simply some pieces of information or functions a certain
            webpage or application provides to you. Like the dimensions of the
            brwoser window they're part of an api you don't code the mechanis of
            getting the dimensions yourself you just use it

              as far as I understood from

              it's a function you use to process (or transform) the value before
              it's returned from the parse

            <img src="images/JSON-reviver.png" alt="" />
            <p>this copy from mdn explains the behaviour in the second code:</p>
            <blockquote class="bg-second-color">
              Specifically, the computed value and all its properties (beginning
              with the most nested properties and proceeding to the original

            <p>the article also says:</p>

              function), the property is deleted from the object. Otherwise, the

              <h4>replacer</h4>
              <p>
                replacer can be a function or an array. As far as I understood
                in case of a replacer function (takes key and value as
                parameters
                <i>
                  with the object in which the key was found is provided as the
                  replacer's this context.</i
                >) you can either alter the values or skip properties with their
                values during stringfication based on a condition.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you return a Number, String, Boolean, or null, the
                  stringified version of that value is used as the property's
                  value. ( the property and it's value are inclueded in the
                  stringfied object)
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you return a Function, Symbol, or undefined, the property
                  is not included in the output.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you return any other object, the object is recursively
                  stringified, calling the replacer function on each property.
                  (didn't quite understand it. Probably it means that the
                  returned object is stringfied as well as I tried it and
                  nothing weird happened)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                in case of a replacer array you simply put only the names of the
                properties you want in the stringfied object (<i>
                  Only string and number values are taken into account; symbol
                  keys are ignored. </i

                characters) if a number is passed it specifies the number of
                spaces before each value in the returned string. And if a string

          <h3>Asynchronous vs Synchronous</h3>
          <p>
            Synchronous means that functions are in a queue each function wait
            for the function before it to finish before it can start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Asynchronous means that functions can work in parallel. Functions
            don't have to wait the functions before it.

          <h3>174 - Call Stack And Web API</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>what is call stack ?</h4>
            <p>
              A call stack is a data structure which basically records where we
              are in the program.
            </p>
            <img src="images/call-stack.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              and it work by the concept of LIFO (last in first out) meaning the
              last task inserted is the first task executed going all the way to
              the origing (like the example in the image above)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>how javascript is a single-thread ascynchronous language ?</h4>
            <p>
              the stack goes executing the code line by line when it finds a
              "timeout function" or any of the ascynchronous functions it sends
              them to the web api (the browser as far as I understand) to handle
              them while it keeps executing the rest of the code
            </p>
            <p>
              then, there is
              <span class="bg-second-color">event loop</span> which checks when
              the call stack is free then starts taking tasks from the callback
              queue and put in the stack so they get executed
            </p>
            <img src="images/async.png" alt="" />
            <p>
              in the image above the common sence is the setInterval waits for
              zero seconds then fires but what you notice is it waited for the
              whole code to get excuted then fired which proves the mechanis in
              the previous paragraph
            </p>

        <section>
          <h3>175 - Event Loop And Callback Queue</h3>
          <p>
            an event loop is (probably) a mechanism that checks if the call
            stack is empty then it brings a task from the callback queue to be
            executed
          </p>
          <p>
            the call back queue is where all the tasks are stored waiting to be
            executed and is where the web api sends back the Asynchronous
            functions that were sent to it to be proccessed
          </p>
          <p>
            the call back queue wroks with the opposite princible of the call
            stack it works with first in first out as you can notice from the
            image below

              it stands for asynchoronous javascript and xml

              AJAX is not a techonology it's an approach using number of

              to make an http request (fetching an api) you use the following

                myReq.open(method(GET|POST), request url, asynchronous flage
                (default is true which is asynchronos), authentications (like
                username and password));
              </p>
              <p>myReq.send();</p>
            </div>
            <ul class="bg-second-col">
              <li>notice the capital and samll letters in XMLHttpRequest()</li>
              <li>
                also notice that you can't chane the previous sequence
                (XMLHttpRequest().open(...).send()) it will throw an error
                (cannot read property of undefined)

            </ul>
            <p>
              when you console.log() the myReq variable it will show you info

          <p>
            there are more codes for the status not just 200 and 404 elzero said

          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            the ready state 4 doesn't mean a succeful request it just tells you

            status can be 404
          </p>
          <p>
            so the general rule is to check if the ready state is 4
            <b>and</b> the status is 200 before processing anything depending on
            that respond to avoid errors

              there is something called callback functions. A callabck function
              is a functions passed to another function so this another functino
              executes the callback function (the function passed to it) after

            promise is the solution for the callback hell, it does the same job

            <p>the main idea in using prmoise is:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                it takes a function that takes two functions as paramaters (one

              </li>
              <li>
                you type code that on success calls the function of success you
                passed and on fail calls the function of fail you passed

            <p>
              <span class="cb">async</span> syntax replaces the old
              <span class="cb">new Promise()</span> and

              functions return promises (yet promises returned form the asynce
              functions are not identical with promises returned from new
              Promise() constructor elzero said he will discuss it later)
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="cb">async</span> syntax is simply adding the keyword

              <span class="cb">await</span> (as far as I understood) replaces
              the <span class="cb">.then()</span> syntax what it does is: it
              waits for the result from whatever is put after it and also makes
              the code after it wait for it to be executed before that code get
              executed (it turns the async into saync in case you want to use
              data returned from an async code)

            <img src="images/async-without-await.png" alt="" />

              as you can see the before and after are logged before the result

            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>

          <h3>187 - Try, Catch And Finally With Fetch</h3>
          <p>
            the mechanism of handling (catching) errors in the async is
            <span class="cb">try{} catch{}</span> and there is also
            <span class="cb">finally{}</span> which does exactly what finally in
            the <span class="cb">then().catch().finally()</span> did
          </p>
          <img src="images/try-catch1.png" alt="" />
          <img src="images/try-catch2.png" alt="" />
          <p class="bg-second">
            elzero emphasised the behavoiur of the async as he didn't need to
            use .then() syntax to log the data inside the async instead he just
            logged the promise <b>after the await</b> as if you didn't type the
            await it will return the promise while pending (it literally doesn't
            wait for the promise)
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            this also works on the fetch() if you don't wait for the
            fetch().json() it returns the promise (this syntax is not the right
            one it's just the concept)
          </p>
          <img src="images/await-fetch.png" alt="" />
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            notice that you need to await the fetch itself and then await the
            fetch.json()
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            the benefit of handling errors not just leaving it for the
            interpreter to log them is the code after these errors-in case of
            handled-continues to be executed which is the behaviour wanted in
            real life applications, but in case you didn't handle the error it
            stops all the code after it from being executed

            is pushed into its place. For the nesting shown above, suppose the

          <p>(promise D, (promise C, (promise X) ) )</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            An action can be assigned to an already "settled" promise. In that
            case, the action (if appropriate) will be performed at the first
            asynchronous opportunity. Note that promises are guaranteed to be
            asynchronous. Therefore, an action for an already "settled" promise
            will occur only after the stack has cleared and a clock-tick has
            passed.

            note that there are a few different cameras in three.js but now we

          </p>
          <p>
            for the <span class="second-color">aspect ratio</span> You almost
            always want to use the width of the element divided by the height,
            or you'll get a squished image.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>render type</h3>
          <span class="cb">const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();</span>
          <p>
            in addition to the WebGLRenderer we use here, three.js comes with a
            few others, often used as fallbacks for users with older browsers or
            for those who don't have WebGL support
          </p>
          <span class="cb">
            renderer.setSize( render area width, render area height, updateStyle
            );
          </span>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            In addition to creating the renderer instance, we also need to set
            the size at which we want it to render our app. It's a good idea to
            use the width and height of the area we want to fill with our app.
            but you can also set any size you want for example you can render to
            the half of the area width and height
          </p>
          <p>
            as for the <span class="bg-second-color">updateStyle</span> it's a
            boolean value to deterimne whether you want the object to be renderd
            on high resolution when you set the size of the render to a value
            less than the size of the canvas (the camera I guess) if you want
            high resolution you don't need to set it as it's true by default. If
            you want the object to be rendered at lower resolution set it to
            <span class="cb">false</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            lastly you add the render element (which is the canvas according to
            the documentation) to the body
          </p>
          <span class="cb">
            document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

            react projects are downloaded without their dependances to reduce
            the size to install all the dependancies all you have to do is to go

            <span class="cb">npm install</span> or
            <span class="cb">npm i</span> and all the dependancies will be
            installed
          </p>
          <p>
            npm knows the dependancies of the project form the
            <span class="cb">dependancies</span> object in the

            </li>
            <li>

            it means you have only one html page (index.html) and all the
            content is being changes and modified by javascript without the need
            for reload, even when changing the url it doesn't really change as
            react intercepts the browser and does the routing itself

              </p>

              <p>
                when I searched about it I found that you can either configure
                it your self through npm and makaing your own eslint config
                file. You can find the rules to include in the config file at
                esling website or you can just add it as an extension in vs code
                check

              <p>when updateing a component state that is an array you:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  make a copy of the array (using

                </li>
                <li>modify the element you want</li>
                <li>set the state to the new array you modified</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                as using <span class="cb">setState</span> what makes react
                re-render the component as it's state changed, but if you try to
                directly change the state without using the setState (which I
                didn't try yet) it might not have any effect
              </p>
              <p>
                also react explained their reasons in the docs

            <li>
              <p>
                when passing a function as a prop make sure you don't include
                its parenthese as that would call it once the component is
                rendered
              </p>
              <img src="images/react-passing-function-as-props.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                and if you have to pass arguments to it so now you have to
                include the parenthese you can pass it in an anonymous like
                <span class="cb">onComponentClick={() => myFun(someVar)}</span>

            <li>
              To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child
              components communicate with each other, declare the shared state
              in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass
              that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the
              child components in sync with each other and with their parent.
            </li>

            <li>
              regular HTML won't always work in react or JSX so you can use a
              <a href="https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx">converter</a> this
              converter can convert way more than just html to jsx give it a

          </p>
          <p>
            When you update a list, React needs to determine what has changed.
            You could have added, removed, re-arranged, or updated the list's
            items.
          </p>
          <img src="images/react-key-why-use-1.png" alt="" />
          to
          <img src="images/react-key-why-use-2.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In addition to the updated counts, a human reading this would
            probably say that you swapped Alexa and Ben's ordering and inserted
            Claudia between Alexa and Ben. However, React is a computer program
            and does not know what you intended, so you need to specify a key
            property for each list item to differentiate each list item from its
            siblings. If your data was from a database, Alexa, Ben, and
            Claudia's database IDs could be used as keys.
          </p>
          <h4>key mechanism</h4>
          <p>
            When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item's key and
            searches the previous list's items for a matching key. If the
            current list has a key that didn't exist before, React creates a
            component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the
            previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys
            match, the corresponding component is moved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows
            React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component's key
            changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new
            state.
          </p>
          <p>
            key is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is
            created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly
            on the returned element. Even though key may look like it is passed
            as props, React automatically uses key to decide which components to
            update. There's no way for a component to ask what key its parent
            specified.
          </p>
          <h4>key rules</h4>
          <p>
            It's strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you
            build dynamic lists.
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            If you don't have an appropriate key, you may want to consider
            restructuring your data so that you do.
          </p>
          <p>
            If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array
            index as a key by default.
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to
            re-order a list's items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly
            passing key={i} silences the error but has the same problems as
            array indices and is not recommended in most cases.
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique
            between components and their siblings.

            <h4>Step 2: Build a static version in React</h4>
            <p>
              now implement the app
              <i class="bg-secon-color">
                The most straightforward approach is to build a static version
                that renders the UI from your data model without adding any
                interactivity
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              (If you're familiar with the concept of state, don't use state at
              all to build this static version. State is reserved only for
              interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is
              a static version of the app, you don't need it.)
            </p>
            <p>
              You can either build “top down” by starting with building the
              components higher up in the hierarchy (like
              FilterableProductTable) or “bottom up” by working from components
              lower down (like ProductRow)
              <i class="bg-second-color">
                In simpler examples, it's usually easier to go top-down, and on
                larger projects, it's easier to go bottom-up
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              according to the docs the rule of thump when sharing data among
              components:
              <i class="bg-second-color">
                the data flows down from the top-level component to the ones at
                the bottom of the tree.
              </i>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>
              Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state
            </h4>
            <p>
              To make the UI interactive, you need to let users change your
              underlying data model. You will use state for this.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>
                Think of state as the minimal set of changing data that your app
                needs to remember
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you're building a shopping list, you can store the
              items as an array in state. If you want to also display the number
              of items in the list, don't store the number of items as another
              state value—instead, read the length of your array.

              <li>
                <b>
                  think of all of the pieces of data in this example

                  <li>
                    Is it

                    via props? If so, it isn't state.

                </ul>
                <p>What's left is probably state.</p>
                <p>for our example:</p>

                  <li>
                    The search text seems to be state since it changes over time
                    and can't be computed from anything.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The value of the checkbox seems to be state since it changes

                  <li>
                    The filtered list of products isn't state because

            <h4>Step 4: Identify where your state should live</h4>
            <p>
              After identifying your app's minimal state data, you need to
              identify which component is responsible for changing this state,
              or <i>owns</i> the state
            </p>
            <p>
              in case you can't identify which component should own the state
              here are some steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Identify every component that renders something based on that
                state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Find their closest common parent component—a component above
                them all in the hierarchy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Decide where the state should live:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Often, you can put the state directly into their common
                    parent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You can also put the state into some component above their
                    common parent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own
                    the state, create a new component solely for holding the
                    state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common
                    parent component.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>now as for our example</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>Identify components that use state:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on
                        that state (search text and checkbox value).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        SearchBar needs to display that state (search text and
                        checkbox value).
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="second-color">Find their common parent:</span>
                    The first parent component both components share is
                    FilterableProductTable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="second-color">
                      Decide where the state lives:
                    </span>
                    We'll keep the filter text and checked state values in
                    FilterableProductTable.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>So the state values will live in FilterableProductTable.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              in the example (which is explained in details in the doc link
              thinking in react) there is search which is an input text inside a
              form when the input value is set to a state variable react threw
              that erorr
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              Warning: You provided a `value` prop to a form field without an
              `onChange` handler. This will render a read-only field. If the
              field should be mutable use `defaultValue`. Otherwise, set either
              `onChange` or `readOnly`.
            </p>
            <p>
              which means that by setting the value of the input without
              providing a function to change it's value on input react will
              ignore the user input the input value will remain the same
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>
                If you try to type or check the box in the example above, you'll
                see that React ignores your input. This is intentional
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>but why is that ? I got to search about it</p>
            <p>
              so the way to make this work right is to add a function on input
              change that changes the state which the input value shows so the
              input value changes with the user input
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            but now there is one weird thing in this tutorial: when we needed
            the input to change the search text state we passed the
            <span class="cb">setSearchText</span> to it as a prop but in
            <a href="https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe"
              >tic tac toe tutorial</a
            >
            the docs literally stated that
            <i
              >Since state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot
              update the Board's state directly from Square</i
            >
            and the way they did that: they created a function in the board (the
            state owner) that changes the state and passed this funciton to the
            square (the state owner's child) as a prop

              to a function. They let a parent component pass data to a child
              component and customize its appearance. For example, a Form can
              pass a color prop to a Button.
            </li>

                State is like a component's memory.
              </span>
              It lets a component keep track of some information and change it
              in response to interactions. For example, a Button might keep
              track of isHovered state.

                html: <span class="cb"><div id="my-app"></div></span> js:

              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>detailed docs</h3>
          <p>
            Every Vue application starts by creating a new application instance
            with the <span class="cb">createApp</span> function:
          </p>
          <div class="cb">
            <p>import { createApp } from 'vue'</p>
            <p>
              const app = createApp({<br />
              /* root component options */
              <br />})
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>the root component</h3>
          <p>
            the root component is the object you pass to the
            <span class="cb">createApp()</span> function where you set opitons,
            methods, children components, etc...
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              Every app requires a "root component" that can contain other
              components as its children.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            best practice:
            <i>
              If you are using Single-File Components, we typically import the
              root component from another file:
            </i>
          </p>
          <div class="cb">
            <p>import App from './App.vue'</p>
            <p>const app = createApp(App)</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Mounting the App</h4>
          <p>
            An application instance won't render anything until its
            <span class="cb">.mount()</span> method is called. It expects a
            "container" argument, which can either be an actual DOM element or a
            selector string:
          </p>
          <p>
            html: <span class="cb"><div id="my-app"></div></span> js:
            <span class="cb">app.mount('#my-app')</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            note that
            <i>
              The container element itself is not considered part of the app
            </i>
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            The <span class="cb">.mount()</span> method should always be called
            after all app configurations and asset registrations are done. Also
            note that its return value, unlike the asset registration methods,
            is the root component instance instead of the application instance.
          </p>

          <h4>In-DOM Root Component Template</h4>
          <p>
            The template for the root component is usually part of the component
            itself, but it is also possible to provide the template separately
            by writing it directly inside the mount container:
          </p>
          <img src="images/vue-in-dom-component-template.png" alt="" />
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            <i>
              Vue will automatically use the container's innerHTML as the
              template if the root component does not already have a template
              option.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            best practice:
            <i>
              In-DOM templates are often used in applications that are using Vue
              without a build step. They can also be used in conjunction with
              server-side frameworks, where the root template might be generated
              dynamically by the server.
            </i>
          </p>

          <h4>App Configurations</h4>
          <p>
            The application instance exposes a .config object that allows us to
            configure a few app-level options, for example, defining an
            app-level error handler that captures errors from all descendant
            components:
          </p>
          <p class="cb">
            app.config.errorHandler = (err) => {<br />
            /* handle error */ <br />}
          </p>
          <p>
            The application instance also provides a few methods for registering
            app-scoped assets. For example, registering a component:
          </p>
          <p class="cb">app.component('TodoDeleteButton', TodoDeleteButton)</p>
          <p>
            This makes the TodoDeleteButton available for use anywhere in our
            app.
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            again:
            <i>
              Make sure to apply all app configurations before mounting the app!
            </i>
          </p>

          <h4>multiple application instances</h4>
          <p>
            You are not limited to a single application instance on the same
            page. The createApp API allows multiple Vue applications to co-exist
            on the same page, each with its own scope for configuration and
            global assets:
          </p>
          <img src="images/vue-multiple-application-instances.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            vue best practice:
            <i>
              If you are using Vue to enhance server-rendered HTML and only need
              Vue to control specific parts of a large page, avoid mounting a
              single Vue application instance on the entire page. Instead,
              create multiple small application instances and mount them on the
              elements they are responsible for.

            <h3>Template Syntax</h3>
            <p>
              Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into highly-optimized
              JavaScript code. Combined with the reactivity system, Vue can
              intelligently figure out the minimal number of components to
              re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when
              the app state changes.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              best practice:
              <i>
                If you are familiar with Virtual DOM concepts and prefer the raw
                power of JavaScript, you can also directly write render
                functions instead of templates, with optional JSX support.
                However, do note that they do not enjoy the same level of
                compile-time optimizations as templates.

                <h4>Text Interpolation</h4>
                <p class="cb">&lt;span&gt; Message: {{ msg }} &lt;/span&gt;</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>raw html</h4>
                <p>
                  text Interpolation works exactly like
                  <span class="cb">.textContent()</span> or
                  <span class="cb">.innerText()</span> (I don't remember the
                  difference between them) meaning if you try to add
                  <span class="cb"
                    >&lt;span&gt; this is a text &lt;/span&gt;</span
                  >
                  it will be added as is, so what if I need it to be compiled as
                  html ? then use <span class="cb">v-html=""</span> attribute
                  and place your html (or an html containing varibale) between
                  the double quotes
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="cb">v-html=""</span> works exactly like
                  <span class="cb">.innerHtml=""</span>

                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  note that in both <span class="cb">{{msg}}</span> and
                  <span class="cb">v-html="msg"</span> if the html element
                  contained a hard coded content it will be overwritten just
                  like in <span class="cb">.textContent=""</span> and
                  <span class="cb">.innerHTML=""</span>

            <h4>Attribute Bindings</h4>
            <p>
              <i class="bg-second-color">
                Mustaches cannot be used inside HTML attributes. Instead, use a
                v-bind directive:
              </i>
            </p>
            <p class="cb">&lt;div v-bind:id="dynamicId"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
            <p>
              binding any attribute means whatever that is between the double
              quotations is a variable although it looks like a regular text
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              note that:
              <i>
                If the bound value is null or undefined, then the attribute will
                be removed from the rendered element.
              </i>
            </p>
            <p>
              shorthand for <span class="cb">v-bind:id</span> is
              <span class="cb">:id</span> and of course it is usable with any
              attribute not just the id

          <div>
            <h4>Boolean Attributes</h4>
            <p class="cb">
              &lt;button :disabled="isButtonDisabled"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              note that if the <span class="cb">isButtonDisabled</span> is
              <b>true</b> then the button will be <b>disabled</b>
            </p>
            <h4>Dynamically Binding Multiple Attributes</h4>
            <p>
              If you have a JavaScript object representing multiple attributes
              that looks like this:
            </p>
            <img src="images/vue-attribute-object.png" alt="" />
            <img src="images/vue-attribute-object-bind.png" alt="" />
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              Each binding can only contain one single expression. An expression
              is a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. A simple
              check is whether it can be used after
              <span class="cb">return</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              which means you can't type something like
              <span class="cb">{{ var a = 1 }}</span> or
              <span class="cb">{{ if (ok) { return message } }}</span>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              It is possible to call a component-exposed method inside a binding
              expression:
            </p>
            <p class="cb">:title="toTitleDate(date)"</p>
            <p class="bg-danger-color">
              Functions called inside binding expressions will be called every
              time the component updates, so they should not have any side
              effects, such as changing data or triggering asynchronous
              operations.

              Template expressions are sandboxed and only have access to a
              restricted list of globals. The list exposes commonly used
              built-in globals such as <span class="cb">Math</span> and
              <span class="cb">Date</span>.

            </p>
            <p>
              Directive attribute values are expected to be single JavaScript
              expressions
            </p>
            <p>
              A directive's job is to reactively apply updates to the DOM when
              the value of its expression changes. Take
              <span class="cb">v-if</span> as an example:
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>argumnets</h4>
            <p>
              some directives take arguments like
              <span class="cb">v-bind:href="value"</span> the href is an
              argument for the v-bind directive
            </p>
            <p>
              you can use dynamic arguments
              <span class="cb">v-bind:[attributeName]="url"</span>
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              you can also use javascript expressions inside the square brackets
              (actually anything inside the [] is evaluated as js expression)
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-co">
              Dynamic arguments are expected to evaluate to a string, with the
              exception of null.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              The special value null can be used to explicitly remove the
              binding. Any other non-string value will trigger a warning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dynamic argument expressions have some syntax constraints because
              certain characters, such as spaces and quotes, are invalid inside
              HTML attribute names. For example, the following is invalid:
              <span class="cb">:['foo' + bar]="value"</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need to pass a complex dynamic argument, it's probably
              better to use a computed property
            </p>
            <p class="bg-danger-color">
              When using in-DOM templates (templates directly written in an HTML
              file), you should also avoid naming keys with uppercase
              characters, as browsers will force attribute names into lowercase:
            </p>
            <p>:[someAttr]="value"</p>
            <p>
              The above will be converted to :[someattr] in in-DOM templates. If
              your component has a someAttr property instead of someattr, your
              code won't work.
            </p>
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              Templates inside Single-File Components are not subject to this
              constraint.

            <h4>Modifiers</h4>
            <p>
              Modifiers are special postfixes denoted by a dot, which indicate
              that a directive should be bound in some special way like
              <span class="cb">@click.right='someFunction'</span> which means on
              right-click only the function will be applied

            in react state is "deeply reactive" which means changes can be
            detected if you mutate a nested objects or arrays

          <div>
            <h4>DOM Update Timing</h4>
            <p>
              When you mutate reactive state, the DOM is updated automatically.
              However, it should be noted that the DOM updates are not applied
              synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" in
              the update cycle to ensure that each component updates only once
              no matter how many state changes you have made.
            </p>
            <p>
              To wait for the DOM update to complete after a state change, you
              can use the nextTick() global API
            </p>
            <pre class="cb">
              import { nextTick } from 'vue'

              export default {
                methods: {
                  async increment() {
                    this.count++
                    await nextTick()

              that are better put in <span class="cb">create</span> instead of
              <span class="cb">methods</span> as it may cause conflict if there

        <p>
          according to the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API"
          >
            docs
          </a>
          The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe
          changes in the intersection of a target element with an father
          (ancestor) element or with a top-level document's viewport.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Intersection Observer API lets code register a callback function
          that is executed whenever a particular element enters or exits an
          intersection with another element (or the viewport), or when the
          intersection between two elements changes by a specified amount. This
          way, sites no longer need to do anything on the main thread to watch
          for this kind of element intersection, and the browser is free to
          optimize the management of intersections as it sees fit.
        </p>
        <p class="cb">
          const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>callback:</b> the function that is called when the element
            intersects it's specified root (the parent you want to watch the
            element intersectio with)
            <p class="bg-second-color">
              notice that while the observation itself occures asyncrounsly (as
              far as I understood),
              <i>
                your callback is executed on the main thread. It should operate
                as quickly as possible; if anything time-consuming needs to be
                done, use Window.requestIdleCallback().

              observer's callback is invoked"
            </i>
            the default behavior like:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>root:</b> The element that is used as the viewport for
                checking visibility of the target. Must be the ancestor of the
                target. Defaults to the browser viewport if not specified or if
                null.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>rootMargin:</b> Margin around the root. A string of one to
                four values similar to the CSS margin property, e.g. "10px 20px
                30px 40px".
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  The values can only be absolute lengths or percentages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This set of values serves to grow or shrink each side of the
                  root element's bounding box before computing intersections
                  (you can use negative values)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Positive values grow the box, while negative values shrink it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>threshold:</b> Either a single number or an array of numbers
                which indicate at what percentage of the target's visibility the
                observer's callback should be executed.
                <p>
                  If you only want to detect when visibility passes the 50%
                  mark, you can use a value of 0.5
                </p>
                <p>
                  The default is 0 (meaning as soon as even one pixel is
                  visible, the callback will be run).
                </p>
                <p>
                  you can also set an array of threshold (the callback is called
                  everytime the element passes one of them) let's say you want
                  the callback to run every time visibility passes another 25%,
                  you would specify the array [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1].

                The list of entries received by the callback includes one entry
                for each threshold-crossing event — multiple entries can be
                received at a time, either from multiple targets or from a
                single target crossing multiple thresholds in a short amount of
                time.

                <i>
                  The entries are dispatched using a queue, so they should be
                  ordered by the time they were generated, but you should
                  preferably use
                  <span class="cb"> IntersectionObserverEntry.time </span> to
                  correctly order them.
