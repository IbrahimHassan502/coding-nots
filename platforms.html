          <p>
            wordpress is an open source software which means you can take a
            version an customize it as you whish

            <h2 class="main-heading">two options</h2>
            <p>
              when it comes to making websites on wordpress you have two
              optoins:
            </p>
            <ul class="big-items">
              <li>
                <p>
                  first you can make it on
                  <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>
                  which has the wordpress version setup, updated, secure and
                  ready to go. which means you don't have to see what are the
                  security problems and solve them and you don't need to check
                  for updates. Just pick your plan and go
                </p>
                <h3 class="second-heading">disadvantages</h3>
                <p>
                  far less customizable compared with the second option which is
                  taking a version of wordpress on your machine and work it
                  yourself as at the end of the day in case of
                  <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> they manage
                  the website not you
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  second option is as mentioned is to download the software from
                  <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">
                    wordpress.org/download
                  </a>

          <p>where you can:</p>
          <ul>

                  <i>
                    categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name
                    (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the
                    categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult
                    to change this, so if you don't want your categories sorted
                    alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them
                    presented on the screen.

              <h3>homepage slider</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  in the
                  <span class="cb">
                    appearance > customize > home page sections > slider section
                  </span>
                  from the left bar of the dashboard you will notice if you
                  enabled the slider section with your default theme it won't
                  appear that's because it shows on the page you set as the home
                  page from
                  <span class="cb">
                    settings > reading > your home page displays > a static page
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  let's say you chos a page called "courses" to be your home
                  page then it will have the slider on it
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  but notice if you set your home page to display the
                  <span class="cb">latest posts</span> and then go to the
                  courses page it won't have the slider as it's not a home page
                  anymore
                </p>
                <p>
                  also notice when you make a certain page that is in the nav
                  bar the home page both the home and that page are highlighted
                </p>
                <img src="images/wp-home-page-nav-bar.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  and when you click on home while on the "courses" page the
                  page will be the same which makes the website looks broken so
                  my recommendation is to remove that page from the nav bar or
                  choose the home page one that is not on the navbar
                </p>

              <h3>bloginfo() vs get_bloginfo()</h3>
              <p>
                as far as I understood from the user contributed notes of
                <a
                  href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/bloginfo/#user-contributed-notes"

                  bloginf docs
                </a>
                if you need the value to use in a php variable use the
                <span class="cb">get_bloginfo()</span> as it returns that value
                while <span class="cb">bloginf()</span> just echos the value
                (like console.log()) and if you set it to a variable the
                variable will be empty
              </p>

                  installation docs
                </a>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  go to your theme folder and either open a powershell window or
                  open it with vs code then open the terminal
                </li>
                <li>
                  install tailwind
                  <span class="cb">npm install -D tailwindcss</span> then create
                  tailwind config file

                </li>
                <li>
                  inside the "tailwind.config.js" put the paths to the files
                  that use tailwind it should look something like that
                  <span class="cb">
                    content:
                    ["./*.{php,html,js}","./template-parts/*.{php,html,js}"]
                  </span>
                  (if you have a template-parts folder of course)
                  <p class="bg-danger-color">
                    just make sure there is no space after the coma in the
                    content array between the two paths as it will cause a
                    warning of "no utility classes detected"
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  create a <span class="cb">src</span> folder and then create
                  <span class="cb">input.css</span> inside of it (you don't have
                  to create the src folder actually as long as you put the right
                  path to the input.css in the
                  <span class="cb">
                    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css
                    --watch
                  </span>
                  command)
                </li>
                <li>
                  inside the input.css you put
                  <pre class="cb">
                @tailwind base;
                @tailwind components;
                @tailwind utilities;
              </pre
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  then make sure your terminal is in the root folder of your
                  theme (not any subfolder in the theme folder) and run
                  <span class="cb">
                    npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css
                    --watch
                  </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  now we have to include the "output.css" in the style of our
                  theme so he goes to <span class="cb">functinos.php</span> and
                  adds the highlighted line in the function screenshot below (I
                  didn't build the functions.php with elzero yet so I'm not
                  trying this)
                  <img src="images/wp-include-tw-output-css.png" alt="" />
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                the first time I added a tailwind class the output.css version
                on wordpress didn't update although it was updated on pc so you
                might have to hold shift on keyboard while refreshing or clear
                browser cache or just give it a little time
              </p>

              <h3>google fonts in wordpress</h3>
              <p>
                the problem with adding google fonts is that two styles have
                <span class="cb"> rel='preconnect' </span> and one of them even
                have an attribute <span class="cb">crossorigin</span> while the

                  first you need to download local server like

                    >XAMPP</a

                    in the setup file of xampp wherever you chose it find

                  after un-zipping the file copy the wordpress folder (which

                    after you finish the install that link will lead you to the

                in case he wants to make another wordpress installation bu it

              <h3>06 - Setup WordPress On DirectAdmin</h3>
              <p>
                explained how to install wordpress if you have a domain and
                hosting, just like local wordpress install but on the server you
                bought
              </p>
              <p>
                also explained how to upload the files and manage them using
                <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">filezilla ftp</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                didn't find it suitable for me in the mean time so didn't take
                notes

              <h3>07 - Setup WordPress on cPanel Website</h3>
              <p>
                same as the previous lesson but using "cPanel" instead of
                "DirectAdmin"
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>08 - WordPress in Your Language</h3>
              <p>
                to change the language simply go to sittings and you will find
                'site language' showing you the installed and available
                languages
              </p>
              <p>choose the language then hit save changes at the page</p>
              <p>
                you can find the installed language files by going to the
                wordpress folder inside htdocs ===> wp-content ===> languages
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                notice that at first the folder languages won't exist unless you
                change the site language one time at lease
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                also notice that here we're changing the panel and controls
                language not the site content language (this is not how you make
                multilangual website)
              </p>
              <p>
                elzero went on and explained how you can make your own language
                files for wordpress and how to contribute in the translation
                projects but I found the info irrelvant so didn't take notes
                about it

              <p>
                talking about each tabel in the wp database in case you needed
                to do major changes like changing a certain phrase or link that
                exists in hundreds of posts or in case you got hacked and don't
                have the admin username and password. From the database you can
                enter on admins and change the email and password
              </p>

                <li>
                  wp_links: contains all the external links (elzero said it was
                  about comptability and should be removed in the future and
                  today is 17/11/2022 and it still here)

              <h3>#10 - Tips to Secure Your WordPress Website</h3>
              <p>
                before securing wordpress you have to secure your machine (he
                won't talk about securing your machine he will talk about
                wordpress)
              </p>
              <p>quick tips to secure your wordpress site:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    first way is to secure the dashboard: one way to get to the
                    dashboard is to type in the link of your wordpress site
                    (either locally so you go to localhost/wordpress or hosted
                    so you type the url to the domain you purchased) followed by
                    <span class="cb">/wp-admin</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    you can make a firewall on any folder you have on your
                    website (including the wp-admin) to make a firewall:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>elzero went to <span class="cb">direct admin</span></li>
                    <li>
                      chose <span class="cb">password protected directory</span>
                      <img
                        src="images/wp-direct-admin-password-portected-directory.png"
                        alt=""
                      />
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      chose
                      <span class="cb"
                        >find a directory to password protect</span
                      >
                    </li>
                    <li>chose <span class="cb">wordpress</span></li>
                    <li>chose <span class="cb">wp-admin</span></li>
                    <li>
                      in the
                      <span class="cb">protected directory prompt</span> you
                      type the message you want it browsed on the firewall (like
                      staff only or whatever)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      type in the user who can access through the fire wall
                    </li>
                    <li>type in the password</li>
                    <li>
                      check the
                      <span class="cb">protection enable</span> checkbox before
                      the <span class="cb">save</span> button
                    </li>
                    <li>hit <span class="cb">save</span></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    now when you try to access the dashboard you'll be asked to
                    enter the username and password of the fire wall (to be able
                    after that to enter the username and password to the actual
                    site)
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/wp-dashboard-firewall.png" alt="" />
                  <p class="bg-second-color">
                    now notice if you type the website link followed by
                    <span class="cb">/wp-login.php</span> it will open the
                    dashboard login page just fine without authintication or
                    firewall
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    to solve the previous problem you can add a rename plugin to
                    your website that will rename the
                    <span class="cb">wp-login.php</span> for you so the hacker
                    can't access it
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    in the video elzero just googled
                    <span class="cb">wp-login rename</span> and said that you
                    can find the plugin that suites you best
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    another tip is to always make sure to update the wordpress
                    version (from the dashboard) as they continously patch
                    loopholes
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    also you can enable auto update but be aware is it may break
                    some stuff down in some customized wordpress versions
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    just google wp auto update and you will find some codes to
                    add to the wp-config file (he illustrated how to auto update
                    I just don't have energy to type)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  only use the absolute neccessary plugins don't take the easy
                  route and make any small thing using plugin just because you
                  don't want to search how it's done
                </li>
                <li>
                  don't use cracked or nulled plugins as it will probably
                  contain viruses
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    make sure your password to access the site is hard to crack
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    you can use a password generator like
                    <a href="https://my.norton.com/extspa/passwordmanager">
                      identity safe
                    </a>
                    from norton
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    and with such hard randomly generated password you might
                    want to use a passowrd saving application like
                    <a href="https://www.roboform.com/"> roboform </a> or you
                    can just count on <span class="cb">google password</span>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  you can use a plugin to make a
                  <span class="cb">two step verfication</span> or 2fa so when
                  someone tries to access the website it won't let him (with the
                  right username and password) it won't let him untill you verfy
                  the login from your phone
                </li>
                <li>
                  make sure you're with a good hosting company so the hacker
                  doesn't hack you from the server
                </li>
                <li>
                  make sure you're using the right file permissions (he
                  illustrated them but I didn't like to type them)
                </li>
                <li>
                  change the database prefix (wp_) to a hard complicated prefix
                  so when the hacker tries to inject tables in the database and
                  he can't know the right prefix he simply won't be able to
                  inject these tables or they won't be effective
                </li>
              </ul>

              <div>
                <h4>revisions</h4>
                <p>
                  when you make several modification on a draft wordpress saves
                  every version of the draft just like github
                </p>
                <img src="images/wp-revisions.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  when you click on it it will show you a comparison between the
                  latest version (on the right) and the previous version (on the
                  left) with a plus icon beside the added lines, and a minus
                  icon beside the removed lines
                </p>
                <p>
                  you can go from a versino to another using the slider at the
                  top of the page with every line in the slider representing a
                  version
                </p>
                <img src="images/wp-version-slider.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  also you can compare between any two versions by checking the
                  "compare any two versions" checkbox on the right of the slider
                </p>
                <p>you can restore any revision you want</p>

                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  it's a little annoying that wordpress compares versions in the
                  code status not in the visual one so try to search how to make
                  the comparison in the visual editor or status
                </p>

              <div>
                <h4>article status</h4>
                <p>
                  the default status is <span class="cb">draft</span> if you're
                  done and want it to be reviewed by one of your team you can
                  change it's status to
                  <span class="cb">pending review</span> by checking the
                  checkbox in the settings panel

                <p>
                  then it will be added to the bending tab in the posts page

                <p>obvously the schedule time is based on your timezone</p>
                <p>
                  funny enough I found out that mytime zone was set to utc+0 and

              <h3>#16 - WordPress Post Format</h3>
              <p>
                according to
                <a
                  href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/post-formats/"
                >
                  wp docs
                </a>
                some themes support post format features and others don't
              </p>
              <p>
                from my exploration the post option panel on the right isn't
                affected by the theme (I guess) and for some reason I can't see
                the post format dropdown
              </p>
              <p>
                and when I watched a
                <a href="https://youtu.be/qzKoFZtnRqo?si=0KYIJ5b4sQRzGmgv">
                  youtube video
                </a>
                from earlier this year he had it
              </p>
              <img src="images/wp-post-format.png" alt="" />
              <p>the below image is from my pc</p>
              <img src="images/wp-post-format-not-found.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                also I watched another
                <a href="https://youtu.be/MwkZiw9JaKM?si=jP_0TkDeJmBwiYMu">
                  youtube viedo
                </a>
                that guided me on how to change the default post format
                (settings > writing > Default Post Format) and that one I found
                so the feature is not removed from wp and I got to figure out a
                way to find it in the post page
              </p>
              <img src="images/wp-default-post-format.png" alt="" />
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>#17 - WordPress Categories vs Tags</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  the best way to understand the difference is with examples
                </p>
                <p>an example of a category is html, css, wordpress, etc...</p>
                <p>and an example of a tag is news, tips&tricks, functions</p>
                <p>
                  so you can find the "news" tag in all the sections, in another
                  word if you click on "news" it will show you all the news in
                  all categories
                </p>
                <p>
                  sometimes a post can belong to more than one category like
                  "how to build that in html and css" that belongs to both html
                  and css categores and you can specify more than one category
                  in wordpress when you're making the post
                </p>
                <img
                  src="images/wp-post-anatomy.png"
                  alt="wordpress post anatomy"
                />
                <p>note that the cateogries and the tags are clickable</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  when you go to the tag page (from posts on the left bar) you
                  will see "count" column in the tags table showing you how many
                  times that tag was used
                </p>
                <p>
                  and if you click on the number it will show you a table of all
                  the posts containing that tag
                </p>
                <img src="images/wp-tags.png" alt="wordpress tag table" />
              </div>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>#18 - WordPress Screen Options</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  in the main dashboard you can show/hide the panels you want
                  from the
                  <span class="cb">screen options</span> at the top right of the
                  screen
                </p>
                <img
                  src="images/wp-screen-options-closed.png"
                  alt="wordpress dashboard screen options"
                />
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  note that there are different screen options for every tab in
                  the left bar, which means the options for the dashboard for
                  example is different from the options of the posts and so on
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  even the options in the adding new post page are different
                  from those in post table page
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  in the post page there is
                  <span class="cb">view mode</span> option
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the compact one just shows you the title of the post</li>
                  <li>
                    while the extended view shows you "excerpt" of the post
                    beneath the post title which we will show how to set in a
                    minute but in case it's not set it just shows you the
                    content of the post
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <img
                  src="images/wp-post-view-mode.png"
                  alt="wordpress post page with comapct view mode"
                />
                <img
                  src="images/wp-post-extended-view-mode.png"
                  alt="wordpress post page with extended view mode"
                />
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  so elzero use the screen options in the add post page to add
                  the "excerpt" and to set the "discussion" which both we will
                  explain but apparently in that version I'm working on (or in
                  the theme I'm not sure) there are no screen options so the two
                  options I just mentioned will be found in the settings bar on
                  the right at the very bottom
                </p>
                <img
                  src="images/wp-excerpt-and-discussion.png"
                  alt="excerpt and discussion place in the add post page"
                />
                <p>
                  as for the excerpt if you open it, it will show you a text
                  area to type the excerpt you want for the post
                </p>
                <p>the discussion panel contains to options</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>allow comments</li>
                  <li>
                    pingbacks&amp;trackbacks: if checked it sends you a
                    notification whenever another blog puts a link to that post
                    as something like reference, if you allow the "bingback" it
                    shows at the comments of that post as the text of the other
                    post with a link to, of course if you deni it it won't show
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  elzero also showed option of adding link to another post as a
                  reference but I just can't find that
                </p>
                <p>
                  from what I understood from short searching whenever you put a
                  link to a wordpress post of another blog wordpress
                  automatically sends them notification if they enable the
                  bingbacks on that post
                </p>
                <p>
                  to
                  <span class="second-color">globally disable bingbacks</span>
                  go to settings > discussion > in the "default post settings"
                  section uncheck "Allow link notifications from other blogs
                  (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new posts" and from the name it
                  disables that option for future posts not the already posted
                  ones
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  if you go to the post page, selected multiple posts, and from
                  the
                  <span class="cb">bluk action</span> drop down chose
                  <span class="cb">edit</span> then hit apply it will show you
                  the options you can do to these posts like adding them all to
                  a category (at that case each post will be in his original
                  categories plus that category or categories you chose) or
                  maybe move them all to trash, change their dates, just explore
                  these options
                </p>

              <h3>#19 - Featured Image and Permissions</h3>
              <p>the featured image is the main image of the post</p>
              <img src="images/wp-featured-image-example.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                now you can have as many images inside of the post but only the
                featured image is gonna be showed as the image of the post
              </p>
              <p>
                elzero spoke about a problem that you might encounter which is
                that wordpress is unable to upload the image
              </p>
              <p>
                that problem is due to the wordpress not having the premission
                to write in the <span class="cb">wp-content</span> folder
                (problem from the hosting company)
              </p>
              <p>
                to solve that problem you go to the ftp program you're using
                (the program showing you the wordpress folders on the server) >
                right click on <span class="cb">wp-conetent</span> > premissions
                it will show you the dialouge in the below image
              </p>
              <img src="images/wp-premissions.png" alt="" />
              <p>these premissions are the right ones</p>
              <p>
                as for the number in the
                <span class="cb">numeric value</span> field (775):
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>775 => public can't right</li>
                <li>777 => public can right</li>
                <li>755 => neither public nor group can right</li>
                <li>555 => no one can right</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I didn't search in the difference between the owner, the group,
                and the public but from what I understood from elzero the owner
                is simply you, the group is you, wordpress, filezilla and any
                software you're using, and the public are just the users of the

              <h3>#20 - Media and How to Attach Images</h3>
              <p>
                in the media page (from the left bar) you can find all the
                images, videos, etc... you uploaded to the website you can also
                upload media straight to that page to add them later in your
                posts
              </p>

              <ul>
                <i>
                  if you change the view mode (between the 2 icons highilghted
                  by the pink rectangular) to the list mode you can see details
                  like where the image is used (if attached) or if its just
                  unuttached
                </i>
                <li>
                  you can use the filter (all media items dropdown) to give you
                  better control like you can choose to show only the unattached
                  media and delete all of them (you have to hit the
                  <span class="cb">filter</span> button so the filter you chose
                  is applied)
                </li>
                <li>

                      <p>
                        attaching the media to a certain post (attach > choose
                        the post/s you want)
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      go to the post you attached it to (the image won't be
                      shown yet)

                        <span class="cb">uploaded to this post</span> it will
                        show you only the image attached to the post

              <p>
                it feels like important info but I didn't feel like it the only
                take is you can add new pages (home, about us, contact, etc...)
                from the pages page from the left bar
              </p>
              <p>

                  if that comment is just advertisement or an annoying person
                  you can click "spam" I'm not sure if it prevents that user
                  from commenting again or what

                <li>finally you can delete that comment by clicking 'trash'</li>

              <h3>#24 - Appearance - Customize</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  the customize page (which opens when you hover over
                  <span class="cb">appearance</span> from the left bar then
                  choose <span class="cb">customize</span> ) offers you alot of
                  options to change the visuals of the theme
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>change the background color</li>
                  <li>add a background image</li>

                  <li>add widgets etc...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  notice when you change the layout of the blog or single post
                  page to have a side bar you will see that it's just an empty
                  space that's because you didn't add widgets to it yet
                </p>
                <p>
                  to add widgets to the sidebar go to the widget panel from the
                  customize page choose the sidebar then click the plus icon
                </p>
                <p>
                  at first it will show the text stuff like paragraph, heading,
                  list scroll press the
                  <span class="cb">browse all</span> button then scroll until
                  you reach the widget group then you will find widgets like
                  calendar, latest posts, latest comments
                </p>
                <p>
                  as for the social media links widget you will notice when
                  adding a new icon it doesn't show up in the page that's
                  because you didn't set a link to it yet so you click on the
                  icon and add the link and it will show up
                </p>
                <img src="images/wp-social-icons-widget.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  just make sure to click on the social media icon itself not
                  the color around it
                </p>
                <p>
                  you can also change the order of the widgets in the side bar
                  by draging the six dots icon above the widget
                </p>

                    from the <span class="cb">homepage settings</span> you can
                    choose which page of your website you want to be the main
                    one or just make the latest post page the main one

                <li>
                  <p>
                    from the home page sections you can enable/disable and edit
                    sections like (slider, gallery, upcoming events, etc...)

                he just showed the different widget pages of different themese
                emphasizing the info he said about every theme has different
                widgets of its own

              <h3>#26 - Appearance - Menu</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  from the <span class="cb">menus</span> page that is under
                  appearance in the left bar of the dashboard you can control
                  all the menus of your website
                  <span class="bg-second-color">including the nav bar</span>

                <img src="images/wp-menus-page.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  on the left you will find the items that you can add to a menu
                  and as you can deduce menus are not just for pages you can
                  also add posts, categories or custom links
                </p>
                <p>
                  the custom link is added by putting the url you want the link
                  to go to and the link text and it will be added just like any
                  other nav bar link
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  your menu won't show in the website if you don't specify it's

                  some themes offer only one location for menus (like the one in
                  the image) and some others offer more
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  note that some themes provide a default navigation bar don't
                  think that it is the one you made until you set the location
                </p>
                <p>
                  some default nav bars might seem distorted or out of style
                  (like one theme the links didn't have spaces between them and
                  looked like "homeaboutuscontact") but once you make your own
                  nav bar and assign it's location to primary things will work
                  just fine

                directly modifying the theme files is not recommended and I can
                either:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  make a
                  <a
                    href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/"
                    >child theme</a
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  or use the a file manager to make a copy of the main theme so
                  in case things didn't go well you can revert back to that
                </li>
                <li>
                  or add your css in the
                  <span class="cb">additional css</span> page that is in the
                  <span class="cb">customize</span> page from the left bar in
                  the dashboard
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                so when I made a change in the
                <span class="cb">theme file editor</span> page it was added to
                the code but it was never showed but when I made the same change
                in the <span class="cb">additional css</span> it was showed I
                don't know the reason
              </p>
              <p>
                elzero also said that editing the code directly in the
                <span class="cb">theme file editor</span> page is not
                recommended and he recommended editors you can add your server
                in and make the changes from like:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>phpstorm</li>
                <li>comdo ide</li>
                <li>Aptana studio</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                which I made a quick search and found that they were php IDEs
                and that visual studio code was also on the list
              </p>
              <p>
                elzero talked about how sometimes you might not find the
                <span class="cb">update file</span> button that's due to
                wordpress doens't have the premission to write in the file
              </p>
              <p>
                to find this file to change it's premissions go to
                <span class="cb">wp-content</span> >
                <span class="cb">theme</span> > find the folder with the theme
                name you want to modify > then the file you want to modify (in
                my case it was <span class="cb">style.css</span> )
              </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        one with a plugin called "updraft" which seems to be the
                        industry standard and he explained how to make the
                        plugin automatically backup your website on daily,
                        weekly bases
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        the other one is with the command line which can also be
                        automated and free

                  <li>
                    you can also find the database on your pc in that route
                    <span class="cb">C:\xampp\mysql\data\wordpress</span> maybe
                    you can just copy those I don't know

                    <p>
                      well I deduced since the files are already on your pc in
                      case of localhost just go to
                      <span class="cb">C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress</span> and you
                      either copy all the files in there to your backup folder
                      or you just go to the htdocs and copy the wordpress folder
                      itself
                    </p>
                  </li>

                elzero mentioned that there is a backup option for the whole
                website in the control panel but that would backup alot more
                files than just wordpress database and files so unless you only
                have the wordpress on your website this option is not
                recommended

                  detected that and asked him for some info of his website so he
                  doesn't have do add the api manually
                </p>

                <p>
                  it will open you the settings page of the plugin to set the
                  preferences you like and as you can notice at the end of the
                  first section of the page you can
                  <span class="cb">disconnect this account</span>
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  to add a new plugin just click the
                  <span class="cb">add new plugin</span> button at the top left
                  of the page
                </p>
                <p>
                  the first thing you will see at the very top of the page an
                  alert to remind you of the plugins your installed theme
                  requires (if there any and you didn't install them)
                </p>
                <p>
                  under that you will find four tabs (featured, popular,
                  recommended, favorites)
                </p>
                <p>
                  and on the left of that you will find a search bar with a
                  search filter on it's left to etiher search with a keyword,
                  author, or tag
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  under each plugin you will find the star rating of it and at
                  the right hand side of that rating you will find either
                  <span class="cb"
                    >Compatible with your version of WordPress</span
                  >
                  or <span class="cb">not tested on your version yet</span> you
                  have to be attention for that in order not to missing anything
                  up by adding an untested plugin
                </p>
                <p>
                  on the right side of the plugin icon you will find under
                  install
                  <span class="cb">show details</span> which will take you to
                  the plugin page on wp to know more about it and see the
                  reviews
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="second-color">also</span> at the very top of the
                  page you will find
                  <span class="cb">upload plugin</span> button in case you
                  created a plugin yourself and want to add it

              <div>
                <p>
                  mostly when you install any new plugin it adds pages to the
                  settings tab on the left bar and my add options in the
                  customize, appearance tabs etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                  you can find the plugins' files in wp folder under

                  the third tab in plugins page is
                  <span class="cb">plugin file editor</span> which enables you
                  to modify the plugin codes just like we did in the theme file

                  from the users page on the left bar of the dashboard you can
                  manage all the users of your website either if they're
                  (editors, subscribers, conteributers, etc...)

                      when I changed my name it was immediately changed in the

                    <p>
                      elzero said the <span class="cb">username</span> (the one
                      you log into the admin dashboard with) is disabled to

                  at the very bottom of the profile page under account

              <div>
                <p>
                  elzero started by talking about
                  <span class="cb">press it</span> tool which is a tool you pin
                  to your browser bookmark bar and when clicking on it while you
                  have any article or post (that is not on your website) it
                  takes the image and first paragraph of the post and put them
                  in a post editing for you (a quick way to copy someones post)
                </p>
                <p>
                  but it looks like it has been removed as I can't find it in my
                  versoin
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>import</h4>
                <p>
                  the import page is made for migration from other platforms
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    you get your posts and media exported from the platform you
                    are at
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    then you import that from the import page in wordpress and
                    walla you migrated your website to wordpress
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  the import page offers you to import from many platforms like
                  (blogger, livejournal, tumbler, etc...)
                </p>
                <p>it also offers to import posts from rss feeds</p>
                <p>
                  it also offers import from wordpress in case you want to move
                  content between wp websites
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>export</h4>
                <p>
                  this page offers to download your posts, media ,etc.. so you
                  can either import them in another platform or to different wp
                  website
                </p>
                <p>you have two options in export:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="cb">all content:</span> contain your posts,
                    pages, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags, terms,
                    navigation menus, and custom posts.
                  </li>
                  <li>or choose certain pieces (posts,pages,media)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  when you try to import an export wp will tell you "choose a
                  wxr file to import" wxr stands for wordpress extended rss it's
                  not a special format or anything just xml file like any other
                  export file
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>backup vs export</h4>
                <p>
                  the export uses the links of your content not the actual
                  content so if that content is not live on the internet it
                  won't get imported (wheather or not the imported content
                  sticks with you after you delete the original one that's
                  something I don't konw yet)
                </p>
              </div>

                      as far as I understood you can change the url of your

                      "elzro.net") and it will still take you to the wordpress
                      installation, and he mentioned that it is good for
                      security as it wouldn't reveal your wp installation path

                    <p>
                      althought elzero showed in some sort of documentation that
                      the built-in post via email is depricated it still shows
                      at my wp version 7 years later so I don't know if it's
                      really depricated or not

                    <p>
                      the documentation elzero showed also suggested using

                  you can also make your custom structre at the section that is

                  a page where you set your privacy policy (or you can use wp's

                </p>

              <div>
                <h4>wordpress version</h4>
                <p>
                  you can know the wp version by going to wp folder on your pc
                  or your server > <span class="cb">wp-includes</span> >
                  <span class="cb">version.php</span>
                </p>
                <img src="images/wp-version.png" alt="" />
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>why would you need to know wp version</h4>
                <p>
                  in case of the website got hacked and you want to setup a new
                  clean wp installment you need the version to download it
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  also the <span class="cb">wp-includes</span> contains the
                  <span class="cb">widgets</span> folder
                </p>
                <p>
                  the <span class="cb">wp-admin</span> is for the dashboard
                  files
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>wp-content</h4>
                <p>contains</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>languages: the site installed languages</li>
                  <li>plugins</li>
                  <li>themes</li>
                  <li>
                    upgrade: as far as I understood from elzero it contains
                    files that help the wp version update then get deleted
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    upgrade-temp-backup: no idea what that is and it wasn't at
                    elzero's
                  </li>
                  <li>uploads: contains all your media</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>why to know the folder structure</h4>
                <p>
                  according to elzero: in case wp can't add something like a
                  plugin or a theme, etc... due to premissions you can go to the
                  folders on the pc or the server and add them yourself
                </p>
                <p>
                  elzero said as long as you are in the
                  <span class="cb">wp-content</span> it's ok to create folders
                  and add stuff
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4>
                  having a blank page when transferring wp website from place to
                  place?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  elzero said it may be from the plugins to solve this problem
                  you change the name of one plugin and see if still blank get
                  the name back and change another's name and so on until you
                  find the one causing the problem
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                finally elzero talked about the
                <span class="cb">.htaccess</span> file and said it was wp
                configurations for the servers
              </p>

              <h3>#035 - Step Into Developing Theme</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  elzero said you should pay very good attention to
                  <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page"
                    >wordpress codex</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  to make a basic theme you have to have some pages (at elzero's
                  they were stuff like style.css, rtl.css, index.php,
                  comments.php, etc...)
                </p>
                <p>
                  but when I opend the
                  <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development">
                    codex: theme development
                  </a>
                  they said files like (header.php, footer.php, widgets.php,
                  index.php, etc...)
                </p>
                <p>
                  elzero's codex said that
                  <i
                    >the minimum files to make a theme were style.css and
                    index.php</i
                  >
                  but that doesn't show in my codex plus elzero said it's not
                  really a useful info
                </p>
                <p>
                  he also talked about an image that summaryes the relation
                  between pages and said you shouldn't neccessary understand it
                  right now but once you made all these pages it will come handy
                </p>

                <p>
                  elzero also explained that these standards are actually an

                    <p>
                      type
                      <span class="cb">&lt;?php get_header(); ?&gt;</span> which
                      will load your website logo and tagline
                    </p>

              <div>
                <p>
                  to include the footer type
                  <span class="cb">&lt;?php get_footer(); ?&gt;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  note that elzero said you MUST always include the footer even
                  if you didn't have footer of your own, as the footer has all
                  the scripts that wp operates with in it and without you'll
                  have alot of problems with your website
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                then elzero added a side bar widget using
                <span class="cb">&lt;?php get_sidebar(); ?&gt;</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                and also added searh using
                <span class="cb">&lt;?php get_search_form(); ?&gt;</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                and said that you will find all the get() functinos you need in
                codex
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                in case you encoutner a wp function that you don't konw what it
                does go to
                <a href="https://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a> and search
                for it
              </p>
              <p>
                elzero also said to pay a good attention to
                <span class="cb">user contributed notes</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                also said to always type comments in your code it's not wrong
                for comments to be long and thorough

              <div>
                <p>
                  to add an image to your theme (usually a screen shot of how
                  the theme looks like) you go to your theme folder and place
                  the image there naming it <span class="cb">screenshot</span>
                </p>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  note the image's name must be screenshot otherwise it won't

              <div>
                <p>
                  elzero talked about a function called
                  <span class="cb">bloginfo({string})</span> where the string
                  can be any of the options I will list below
                </p>
                <p>
                  this function is used to display information about the current
                  website

                <img src="images/wp-bloginfo-options.png" alt="" />
                <p>
                  there are alot more of options you can find them in the

              <h3>#038 - Create the Header Php File</h3>
              <p>
                he started coding the html boiler plate in a file he created
                called
                <span class="cb">header.php</span> in the theme files
                <span class="cb">
                  except he didn't type the closing tag of &lt;html&gt;
                </span>
                and said "of course we won't close the html tag" which I don't
                konw why
              </p>
              <p>
                the boiler plate is pretty much the same except for some static
                values he used dynamic values instead
              </p>
              <ul class="big-items">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    instead of &lt;html <span class="cb">lang="en"</span>&gt;
                    attribute in the html tag he used &lt;html &lt;?php
                    <span class="cb">language_attributes(); ?&gt; &gt;</span>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    this function includes the both the language of the website
                    and the direction of that language
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    instead of
                    <span class="cb">&lt;meta charset='utf-8' /&gt;</span> he
                    used &lt;meta charset='&lt;?php
                    <span class="cb">bloginf('charset')</span>?&gt;' /&gt;
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  inside the title tags he would've used
                  <span class="cb">wp_title()</span> but he said it has some
                  advance in it and at this point if you use it won't echo
                  anything so we will use
                  <span class="cb">bloginf('name')</span> for now
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    then he added what I believe allows the pingback for your
                    posts
                    <span class="cb">
                      &lt;link rel="pingback" href="&lt;?php
                      bloginf('pingback_url') ?&gt;" /&gt;
                    </span>
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                elzero emphasized that you never add the style or the script of
                the theme by yourself (like &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                href="style.css" /&gt;) and that he will show the proper way to
                add these later
              </p>
              <p>
                then before the <span class="cb">head</span> closing tag you
                should add <span class="cb">&lt;?php wp_head(); ?&lt;</span> as
                it includes wp scripts and styles (I think are for dashboard)
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                the first thing you will notice when you show your theme that
                the website title and tagline are not there anymore and that's
                because the <span class="cb">get_header();</span> in the
                <span class="cb">index.php</span> calls a default wp header if
                it doesn't find <span class="cb">header.php</span> but once you
                create your header.php it includes it instead
              </p>
              <p>
                but notice if you had a missed up header.php the website will be
                missed up it won't fall back to the dafault wp header
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>#039 - Create the Functions Php File</h3>
              <p>
                he created a css, js, fonts folder and added the css, js, fonts
                of bootstrap and fontawesome (and any other library you gonna
                use)
              </p>
              <p>
                currently I'm not using bootstrap I'm using tailwind and it's
                not that straight forward to just download it and find your css,
                js files so follow the steps in
                <a href="#tailwind-in-wordpress">taliwind in wordpress</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                he also created <span class="cb">functions.php</span> where all
                your functions go including these which call the styles and
                scripts of your theme
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>#040 - WP Enqueue Style Function</h3>
              <p>
                in this lesson he explains how to add your style and script
                files and they're added on two steps
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  making a custom function which uses wp function to add the
                  style/script
                </li>
                <li>
                  calling this function using what's called a hook or an action
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                in this lesson he only expalins the first part which is creating
                a custom function with the wp function in it
              </p>
              <p>
                the following functions go in
                <span class="cb">functions.php</span>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  creating a custom function is exaxtly like in js
                  <span class="cb">function add-my-custom-styles() {....}</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  to include the style file we use a wp function called
                  <span class="cb">
                    wp_enqueue_style($handle, $src, $dependancies or $deps,
                    $version or $ver, $media)
                  </span>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span class="second-color">$handle:</span> the name of the
                      stylesheet you're including (and according to the
                      <a
                        href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/"

                        docs
                      </a>
                      it must be unique) but it doesn't have to be the same name
                      on the file so you can be including a file with a name
                      bootstrap.min.css but you give it a name of
                      bootstrap-style
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span class="second-color">$src</span>: the source of the
                      file you're including and it consists of two parts
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          the path up to the theme folder and this one you get
                          using
                          <span class="cb">get_template_directory_uri()</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          the path of the file from that point so it can be
                          somethign like that
                          <span class="cb">/css/bootstrap.min.css</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          and you type the two by concatination so you should
                          type something like that in $src paramater
                          <span class="cb">
                            get_template_directory_uri() .

                    <li>

                      number, if it has one, which is added to the URL as a
                      query string so it is recognized as a new version in case
                      of caching
                      <p>
                        If version is set to false, a version number is
                        automatically added equal to current installed WordPress
                        version. If set to null, no version is added.

                      media it defines The media for which this stylesheet has
                      been defined.
                      <p>
                        the default value is <span class="cb">all</span> but it
                        can be <span class="cb">print</span>,
                        <span class="cb">screen</span>, or
                        <span class="cb">(max-width: 640px)</span> just like the

                    just the handle and src are the required params the others

              </pre>
              <p>
                to add another style you use
                <span class="cb">wp_enqueue_style()</span> again within the

              <p>
                in this lesson he used the wp function of including scripts
                <span class="cb">wp_enqueue_script()</span> and it takes the
                same params as the style funciton except instead of $media
                there's a param called $args which includes 2 options
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="cb">strategy</span> which can be either
                  <span class="cb">async</span> or <span class="cb">defer</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                  and <span class="cb">in_footer</span> which can be
                  <span class="cb">true</span> or
                  <span class="cb">false</span> in case of true scripts are
                  included just before the closing tag of the body which is in
                  most cases the right palce for them
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                if you don't have to specify both strategy and in_footer you can
                just type the value you want like true or async you don't have
                to put them in an array
              </p>
              <p>so the end result should be something like that</p>

              <p>
                note that you have to put the default value of the deps and ver

              <h3>#042 - Add Action and Enqueue Scripts</h3>
              <p>
                after creating two functions to include our styles and scripts
                just like in the js it won't work until it's called so in
                today's lesson we will call them using what's called hook or an
                action and it's like the
                <span class="cb">addEventListner</span> in the js
              </p>
              <pre>
                add_action($hook, $function)
              </pre>
              <p>
                $hook is the name of the event you want to call the function
                with like the 'on-click' in js here we will use
                <span class="cb">wp_enqueue_scripts</span>
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                notice how this one is scripts with an 's' unlike the handle
                used to enqueue the scripts which was just script
              </p>
              <p>this hook is used to enqueue both styles and scripts</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>#043 - WP_Enqueue vs WP_Register</h3>
              <p>
                (as much as I understood) it's a function used to load a script:
                <span class="cb">wp_register_script()</span> or a style
                <span class="cb">wp_register_style()</span> to make them
                available (like a variable) so in case you needed to enqueue
                them multiple times wordpress doens't have to look for them
                every time it just gets the loaded (registered version)
              </p>
              <p>
                just like in js when you create a loop depeneding on the array's
                length you but the length in a variable so the interpreter
                doesn't calculate the length every time the code in the loop
                runs
              </p>
              <p>
                also registered scripts/styles are recognized just by the name
                so (since jquery is registered by wp by default) this code will
                work just fine
                <span class="cb">wp_enqueue_script('jquery')</span> otherwise
                (in case it wasn't registered) it shouldn't be working (I didn't
                really test it)
              </p>
              <p>
                also registered scripts can be used as
                <span class="cb">$deps</span> like
                <span class="cb">
                  wp_enqueue_script('bootstrap-js',
                  get_template_directory_uri(). '/js/bootstrap.js',
                  array('jquery'), false, true)
                </span>
                note that you just type the name of the script (just jquery) and
                it will be loaded
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                but in case of the code above jquery is loaded in the
                <span class="cb">head</span> which is not the right place for
                scripts in the next lesson elzero will show how to put it the
                right place before the body closing tag
              </p>
              <p>
                of course 'jquery' is the <span class="cb">$handle</span> of the
                script which is unique and you can find a list of the
                regiestered scripts by default from wp and their
                <span class="cb">$handle</span> at

                  deregister it then register it again with the

                    <span class="cb">wp-includes</span> folder in which you will
                    find the regiesterd jquery version hence the the path
                    between the ()
                    <span class="cb"> '/js/jquery/jquery.js' </span>

                  create a custom funciton that calls wp function for showing

              <p>
                since we want that navigation menu in the header we go to

                when you call the <span class="cb">wp_nav_menu()</span> without
                its arguments it shows the default menu (which I descripted
                where you can find just above this lesson) which is simpely a
                list of the pages of your website (of course you can customize
                it but this is still the default menu)
              </p>
              <p>
                you can have more than one menu in your website so when you call
                <span class="cb">wp_nav_menu()</span> how do you make it know
                which menu to show

              <img src="images/wp-menus.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                let's say we created another menu called 'short menu' to create
                a new menu you click on the
                <span class="cb">create a new menu</span> which is right below
                the two tabs of <span class="cb">edit menus</span> and

              </p>
              <p>so to show this 'short menu' you have to do 2 steps</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>assign a location to it</p>

                  <p>
                    remember that this 'navigation bar' location is added by you
                    using <span class="cb">wp_register_menu()</span> so it can
                    be called 'my navigation bar' or whatever the $description
                    of the $location has nothing to do with where it goes or any
                    functionality of the menu it's just for the adming of the

                  <p>
                    remember that you can make more than one location so let's
                    make another one
                  </p>
                  <pre class="cb">
                    function register_my_custom_menus()
                    {
                        register_nav_menu(array(
                          'navbar' => 'navigation bar'
                          'footer menu' => 'footer'
                        ));
                    }
                  </pre>
                  <img src="images/wp-menu-location-multi.png" alt="" />
                  <p>
                    as you can see the description is what is shown in the
                    dashboard
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    now that we assigned 'short menu' to 'navigation bar' we
                    have to tell the <span class="cb">wp_nav_menu()</span> the
                    <span class="cb">$location</span> of the 'short menu' to
                    show it
                  </p>
                  <pre class="cb">
                    function show_navigation()
                    {
                        wp_nav_menu(array(
                            'theme_location' => 'navbar'
                        ));
                    }
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    note that <span class="cb">theme_location</span> is a wp
                    argument for wp_nav_menu() function you can see all
                    available arguments
                    <a
                      href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_nav_menu/"
                    >
                      here
                    </a>
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                so let's say you called the funciton with the location of
                'navbar' but you assigned the 'short menu' to the 'footer'
                location then the function will show the dafault menu as it
                found no menu in the location you provided
              </p>

            <p>
              whenever I opened the settings coulnd't find the normal options it
              only showed the protection and security.
            </p>
            <p>
              the problem was from the permissions as I had an employee account
              so the employer had to change my permissons
            </p>
          </div>

              can't delete theme because it's github repo doesn't exsit anymore
            </h4>
            <p>
              simply create another theme with the exact same name from the cli
              making it create identical repo to the one you deleted and now you
              can delete both themes (the original one and the one you just
              created)
