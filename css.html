          <h3>animatoin delay</h3>
          suppose you have multiple elements (say 3) you want to animate them so
          each one is delayed by some duration (say 2s) than the one before it.
          <br />
          instead of using <span class="code-btn">animation-delay</span> css to
          delay each one which is not practical in case of big numners.You but
          customized <span class="code-btn">data-*</span> (say data-delay) on
          each one with the number of seconds (or milliseconds) delay you want
          for thet particular element and then wirte the following css:
          <span class="code-btn">animation-delay: attr(data-delay)</span>
          and now you have as many animations as you want seperated by certain
          cumulative duration with just one line of css üòÉ.

            justify self & justify items <b>work only with grid</b> and don't
            work with <b>flexbox</b>
          </h3>
          <blockquote>
            The <span class="code-btn"> justify-self and </span>
            <span class="code-btn">justify-items</span> properties
            <b>are not implemented in flexbox</b>. This is due to the
            one-dimensional nature of flexbox, and that there may be multiple
            items along the axis, making it impossible to justify a single item.
            To align items along the main, inline axis in flexbox you use the
            justify-content property.
          </blockquote>
          <b>
            as in the flexbox (on the main axis) children are treated as a group

            <span class="second-color">visually: </span>
            <span class="code-btn">align-item</span> aligns each item in its own
            grid area.
          </p>
          <p>
            while in <span class="code-btn">align-content</span> will pack them
            in the top of the container. like shown in the pervious image.

          <p>
            example: <span class="code-btn">align-items: start</span> will
            results in the image below.

          <p>
            <span class="second-color">under the hood: </span>
            <span class="code-btn">align-items</span> sets the value of
            <span class="code-btn">align-self</span> for all child elements at
            once.
          </p>

          <p>
            while <span class="code-btn">align-content</span> deals with the

            <br />
            in the code on mdn the first two elemnts were set to span to rows
            <b>so</b> it's basically stretches from the beginning of the first
            row to the end of the second row and since the space between the
            rows got taller the end of the row got further resulting in the
            elements got taller.

            in the case with just <span class="code-btn">:focus</span> when you

          <h3>place-items</h3>

            its a shorthand for <span class="code-b">align-items</span> and
            <span class="code-btn">justify content</span> respectivly (align
            value comes before justify value) <br />
            <b>note</b> that in flexbox justify-items doesn't work as children
            are treated as one on the main axis so in case of row is main axis
            the second value will be ignored in flexbox. <br />
            <b>
              same explanation goes with
              <span class="code-btn">place-content</span>
              and
              <span class="code-btn">place-self</span> <br />

            according to answer on

          <p>
            this also applies to <span class="cb">&lt;img&gt;</span> as it's a

        <section>
          <h3>using ch instead of %</h3>
          <p>
            there is a unit you can set the width of a paragraph or a
            pragraph-containing elment to set the number of words you want in
            each line which is <span class="cb">ch</span> instead of setting the
            width to percentage, I didn't put it to test yet but it seems more
            responsive and relative to the font the percentage
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>list style</h3>
          <p>
            you can assign <span class="cb">list-style: none;</span> to the
            <span class="cb">&lt;li/&gt;</span> instead of the
            <span class="cb">&lt;ul/&gt;</span> and it will still work

          </div>
          <p>
            the main difference between the two is that use felxbox if you want
            to control the content in <b>one direction</b> (row or column) and
            use grid if you want to control the content in
            <b>both directions</b> (row and column).Like the pervious images may
            illustrate.
          </p>
          <p>
            another piece of advice to help you decide is to ask your self
            <br />
            <span class="second-color"
              >Do you want your content to shape your layout ?</span
            >
            ==> use grid <br />
            <span class="seocnd-color"
              >Do you want your layout to shape your content ?</span
            >
            ==> use grid
          </p>
          <p>
            finally one piece of adviece: In grid-layout there is no way to
            change the size of <b>one single items</b> without changin the whole
            column.
          </p>
          <p>
            my opionion is
            <span class="second-color"
              >what ever gets the job done with less code you go with it</span
            >
            even if in your beginnings you write the same layout twice one with
            grid and one with flex to help you decide it's okay.
          </p>
          <div class="bg-second-color">
            <q class="text-bold">
              I think the key phrase here is ‚Äúdistributing space and aligning
              content‚Äù. Flexbox is all about taking a bunch of things (which
              have varying sizes) and fitting them into a container (which
              itself has a varying size).
            </q>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <q>
                  When people find Flexbox hard and weird, it is often because
                  they are trying to use Flexbox as a grid system ‚Äî trying to
                  take back control over sizing and space distribution. When you
                  do this, Flexbox can seem weird and hard as you are fighting
                  against the very thing that makes it Flexbox, i.e. that
                  inherent flexibility. <br />
                  Therefore, patterns which suit flex layout very well are those
                  where we are not so interested in having a pixel-perfect size
                  for each item. We just want those items to display well
                  alongside each other.
                </q>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>
              Remember that you can also switch layout methods, using Flexbox at
              one breakpoint and Grid at another.

        <h3>media queries for touch screens</h3>
        <p>
          article from
          <a href="https://web.dev/accessible-tap-targets/">web.dev</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the media features we can now test for with media queries is
          whether the user's primary input is a touchscreen (<span class="cb"
            >pointer</span
          >) and whether any of the currently detected inputs is a touchscreen
          (<span class="cb">any-pointer</span>). The
          <span class="cb">pointer</span> and
          <span class="cb">span>any-pointer</span>
          features will return <span class="cb">fine</span> or
          <span class="cb">coarse.</span>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A fine pointer will be someone using a mouse or trackpad, even if
            that mouse is connected via Bluetooth to a phone.
          </li>
          <li>
            A coarse pointer indicates a touchscreen, which could be a mobile
            device but may also be a laptop screen or large tablet.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <li>
              <p>
                we install tailwind using
                <span class="cb">npm install tailwindcss</span>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                but first if you wanna keep track on the depndencies you install
                in your project you have to make a node
                <span class="cb">package.json</span>file using
                <span class="cb">npm init -y</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                and when you install any dependency it will be shown in here
              </p>
              <img src="images/node-package-dependencies.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>using tailwind in your page is like using sass:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  you make a src stylesheet where you import everything belongs
                  to tailwind
                </li>
                <li>
                  then you run a tailwind script that process this style sheet
                  into a final style sheet which you link to your html
                </li>
              </ol>
              <img src="images/tailwind-stylesheet.png" alt="" />
              <p>now why would we do that?</p>
              <p>first you can use tailwind itself (don't know how yet)</p>
              <p>
                and second the good thing with the method is you can add your
                own custom css althogh the purpose of the framework is to not
                type any custom css but sometimes you have to add your own color
                or your own size of font or whatever
              </p>
              <p>
                and from what I know about tailwind so far is that at the build
                it elemenates all unuesd css so maybe thats why we use this
                method
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>file mangement</h3>
              <p>
                all the final page files go in a
                <span class="cb">public</span> folder (it is not mandatory but
                it's best practice I guess)
              </p>
              <p>
                and we make a <span class="cb">src</span> folder to put the src
                stylesheet that tailwind gonna process into the final stylesheet
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              to import tailwind into the src stylesheet you type this at the
              very begining of the page:
              <span class="cb">
                @tailwind base; <br />
                @tailwind components; <br />
                @tailwind utilities;
              </span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                to set the script that converts the src stylesheet into the
                final one:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>go to package.json</li>
                <li>
                  at the "scripts" object you gonna find a test script you can
                  delete that if you want
                </li>
                <li>
                  inside the scripts object you gonna type the name of the
                  script you want lets call "build-css"
                </li>

            Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML, JavaScript
            components, and any other template files for class names, then
            generating all of the corresponding CSS for those styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            which means you have to provide tailwind the path of the files that
            use its class

          <h3>#5 - Tailwind Config</h3>
          <p>
            to generate a tailwind config file with all the utilities in it go
            to the termnal and type
            <span class="cb">npx tailwindcss init --full</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            but if you want to add your own or modify on tailwind you don't deal
            with this config file instead you generate a blank config file that
            has all your modification in order not to mess anything in the
            frameword and in order to be able to distinguish between your own
            css and tailwind's css
          </p>
          <p>
            to generate tailwind blank config file you type in the termnal
            <span class="cb">px tailwindcss init</span>
          </p>
          <p>if you want to add your own css like your theme colors</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                first you can visit these
                <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme">docs</a> to know
                the rules of adding your own css
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-customization.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>go to your <span class="cb">tailwind.config.js</span></li>
            <li>you will find an <span class="cb">extend</span> object</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                and you add whatever you want following the rules shown in the
                image above. Like if you want to add a new color you type
                <span class="cb">
                  colors: {"the color you want": "the value",}
                </span>
              </p>
              <p>
                I noticed in the docs that every color has different shadows
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-color-shades.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                but some how couldn't find them in the full config file to try
                to mimc them
              </p>
              <p>but when hovering on a color they start to show</p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-color-shades-config.png" alt="" />
              <p>and that's how to memic them</p>

          <h3>#6 - Custom Fonts</h3>
          <p>to add your custom font</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              include the font in your project either by using the css rule
              <span class="cb">@import</span> or HTML
              <span class="cb">link</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                then go to extend in the
                <span class="cb">tailwind.config.js</span>
                and type
                <span class="cb">
                  fontFamily: {"whatever the name you want": ["value", "value"]

            </li>
            <li>
              then you can use by simply adding the class
              <span class="cb">font-</span>followed by the name you choosed for
              the font (heading in the image above)

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                any class in tailwind can be responive or used condtionally by
                adding the size of the screen you want, column and the the class
                you want <span class="cb">sm:</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                say you want the element to be displayed flex from the meduim
                size screens and up you type it like this
                <span class="cb">md:flex</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                this can be used with
                <span class="second-color">any</span> tailwind class
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-screen-sizes.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                as you can notice in the media queries the sizes are used with
                <span class="cb">min-width</span> which is the mobile first
                approach
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Targeting a breakpoint range</h3>
              <p>
                By default, styles applied by rules like md:flex will apply at
                that breakpoint and stay applied at larger breakpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you'd like to apply a utility only when a specific breakpoint
                range is active, stack a responsive modifier like md with a
                <span class="cb">max-*</span> modifier to limit that style to a
                specific range like: <span class="cb">md:max-xl:flex</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Tailwind generates a corresponding max-* modifier for each
                breakpoint, so out of the box the following modifiers are
                available:

                <span class="cb">min-[the screen size you want]</span> or
                <span class="cb">max-[the screen size you want]</span> modifiers
                to generate a custom breakpoint on the fly using any arbitrary
                value. like <span class="cb">min-[320px]:text-center</span>

            to add your own css like adding a background-image to a certain

          <p>
            in case you have some componenet that is repeated across the website
            like a card or button. Instead of copying and pasting the classes
            around you add these classes to a single class using the
            <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule

              <p>
                that means tailwind can generate classes that are not used in
                your styling just cuz they've been in your text
              </p>
              <p>
                to solve this problem you can use
                <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#prefix">
                  prefixes
                </a>

              <img src="images/tailwind-class-blocklist.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                The blocklist option only affects CSS that would be generated by
                Tailwind, not custom CSS you've authored yourself or are
                importing from another library.
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                Unlike safelist, the blocklist option only supports strings, and
                you cannot block classes using regular expressions.

          <h3>repeated styles</h3>
          <p>
            most of the time you have the same element repeated in the section
            like nav links or 3 card section where you want to add the same
            style classes for all of them. tailwind provided 3 ways to do that
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Multi-cursor editing</h4>
              <img src="images/tailwind-multi-cursor.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Loops</h4>
              <p>
                you can have the info of the elements stored in a text form
                (like an api) and you loop through the element info typing the
                html structure once
              </p>
              <p>
                you can loop over the info using regular
                <span class="cb">js</span> or I lately learned about
                <span class="cb">pug.js</span>
              </p>
              <img src="images/tailwind-loop.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>making an actual component</h4>
              <p>
                the two solutinos above or good for elements that repeat in the
                same section but what if you have an element (component) that
                repeats across the whole website like a button
              </p>
              <p>
                you can either make a template for it using vue or
                <span class="cb">styled</span> element using react
              </p>
              <p>
                or (and I really don't recommend this) you can use the
                <span class="cb">@apply</span> rule
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                but notice that the apply rule is straight css which defeates
                the purpose of using tailwind
              </p>
            </li>

        <section>
          <h3>custom styles</h3>
          <p>
            every custom css you add has a layer to go whether it's in the
            <span class="second-color">base, components</span> or
            <span class="second-color">utilites</span> or even just adding it to
            the <span class="cb">src style</span>
          </p>
          <h3>when and why to use these layers</h3>
          <p>let's start with the <span class="second-color">why</span>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              tailwind organizes the classes in layers where base layer comes
              first then components then utilities where utilities overrides the
              first two layers and components overrides the base styles so
              explicitly categorizing your style helps in override and avoiding
              conflicts
            </li>
            <li>
              when you add your style in a layer it can be used with tailwind
              modifiers like <span class="cb">hover:</span>,
              <span class="cb">md:</span> and so on
            </li>
            <li>
              on build time tailwind removes all unused classes so if you just
              add your style in the src style without putting it in a layer it
              stayes even if it's unused
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="bg-second-color">

        <p>there are multiple ways to animate vectors on website</p>
        <ul>
          <li>aimated svg</li>
          <li>lottie files</li>
        </ul>
        <section>
          <h3 class="main-heading">animated svg</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              open up your vector on any vector software (inkscape, figma,
              etc...)
            </li>
            <li>
              group every part you are willing to animate: like an arm group the
              fingers, the hand the actual arm, maybe the clothes even so they
              are one thing
            </li>
            <li>
              give the group an <span class="cb">id</span> so you can find it
              later in the code
            </li>
            <li>save your svg</li>
            <li>open your svg by any code editor</li>
            <li>
              the animation is just css animation which means it will be typed
              in a <span class="cb">&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</span>, right
              after the opening <span class="cb">&lt;svg&gt;</span> tag put your
              <span class="cb">&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</span>
              <img src="images/svg-style-tag.png" alt="" />
            </li>
            <li>
              start typing your desired id to animate, the keyframes to it, and
              give animtation (straight css)
              <img src="images/svg-css-animation.png" alt="" />
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                but notice most of the time the animation won't go right and the
                part you're trying to animate will have a transform origin way
                out of it's own even if you set
                <span class="cb">transform-origin</span> to it, so one of the
                most important properties to use so everything go right is
                <span class="cb">transform-box: fill-box</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                the above issue usually happens with rotation but I think that
                porperty won't hurt if you added to anything that will be
                aniamte anyway
              </p>
              <img src="images/transform-box-mdn.png" alt="" />

            reference video:

              >Add AMAZING Animations with LottieFiles - SO EASY</a
            >
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>open your svg in any software (I use figma)</li>
            <li>
              <p>
                group everything you are willing to animate first thing
                (otherwise if you group things in later frames the animation
                will be ruined and it will look like it's small pieces being
                re-arranged)
              </p>
              <p>
                also if you rename an element or a group in some frames and
                forgot to rename it in others it will cause a disturbed
                animation
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              copy the frame, change what you want
              <p class="bg-secon-color">
                (I didn't master lottie yet) but as far as I noticed it doesn't
                work if there's a frame within a frame so avoid using frames
                other than the main outer frame
              </p>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                also notice that lottie doesn't recognize sequinces that are not
                in frames so if you will make a componet and use it's varients
                to make the animation change them into frames
              </p>
              <p>
                if you notice that an element you added to the animation (or a
                frame) doesn't show in lottie try ungrouping that element you
                added (or the last added element)
              </p>
              <p>
                I didn't get the full grap over the grouping thing with lottie
                yet but sometimes it works ok when the element is grouped and
                some other times it doesn't
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              from that point you got to options
              <ol>
                <li>
                  convert frames into <span class="cb">prototype</span>
                  <img src="images/figma-prototype-panel.png" alt="" />
                  and then right click open lottie plugin (or add it if you
                  don't already have it in figma) and chose the flow (prototype)
                  you created
                  <img src="images/lottie-figma-prototype.png" alt="" />
                </li>

                <li>
                  or just leave the frames as they are, select all of them right
                  click, open lottie plugin (or add it if you don't already have
                  it in figma) and you will find the
                  <span class="cb">ecport to lottie</span> button active and in
                  cyan background
                  <img src="images/lottie-figma-export.png" alt="" />
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="bg-second-color">
                it's better if you first check the animation with the second
                method after each frame you create just to make sure it works
                fine on lottie then after the whole sequence is done you can
                create a prototype to get the timing and the delay right
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              once the animation is exported hit the
              <span class="cb">add to workspace</span> button at the bottom
              right
            </li>
            <li>
              choose the folder you want then hit
              <span class="cb">save</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              go to your lottie account, find your animation, at the right of
              the top ribbon you will find a download button
              <img src="images/lottie-download-json.png" alt="" />
              so far I only tried the <span class="cb">.json</span> format so I
              will continue explanation based on that
            </li>
            <li>download the json file, add it to your project files</li>
            <li>
              download the lottie library by searching google
              <span class="cb">bodymovin web</span> and yes it's "movin" not
              moving it should take you to this
              <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web/tree/master">
                github repo</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              download the zip file, inside the folder lottie-web-master find
              build then palyer you will find
              <span class="cb">lottie.min.js</span>
              add that one to your project files
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                all instructions you will find in
                <a href="https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/web">lottie web docs</a>
                but I will also type the steps I do in here
              </p>
              <p>add lottite.min.js to your project</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              in your html add a container for lottie to inject the animation
              inside
            </li>
            <li>
              in your javascript add the code in the following image
              <img src="images/lottie-js-initiation.png" alt="" />
              and in the docs they show you the options and what's required and
              what' optional
              <img src="images/lottie-js-initiation-docs.png" alt="" /> and
              that's it! happy animating
            </li>
            <li>
              note that there is other options of using the animation, like when
              you open the animation from your lottie dashboard you can choose
              embed and handoff
              <img src="images/lottie-embed.png" alt="" />
              as you can see there's an
              <span class="cb">assit link</span> which you can put in the
              <span class="cb">path</span> of the bodymovin object in your js
              instead of the local path of the .json file
              <p>you can also change the format of that assit link</p>
              <p>
                or you can just copy the html embed scripts
                <img src="images/lottie-html-embed.png" alt="" />
                or from below that you can find iframe link (don't know what
                Oembed url is yet)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            you can adjust your animation (if you will use the html embed
            options) in their
            <a href="https://lottiefiles.com/web-player">web player</a>
            to find it got to lottiefiles.com hover over integrations in the top

        <section>
          <h3 class="main-heading">100vh is not full screen in mobile</h3>
          <p>
            that problem occures because of the browser ui (the search bar at
            the top) which can lead to the 100vh element to be actually larger
            than the view port
          </p>
          <p>
            the solution to that problem is to use
            <span class="cb">dvh</span> which stands for
            <i>"dynamic viewport height"</i> which continously calculates the
            actual viewport and adjusting the dvh element to it
          </p>
          <p>
            for example at first when you load up the website (and didn't scroll
            yet) the browser ui takes 15% of your view port so you're left with
            85% so the 100dvh element is actually now a 85% of the viewport
            which takes up all the visual space of the website that is infront
            of you
          </p>
          <p>
            when you scroll down the browser ui may go fully invisible of
            partially let's say now it takes only 10% then your 100dvh element
            takes up 90% of the viewport which again all the space visible
            infront of you
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            note that there is lvw and lvh which stands for
            <i>"larg viewport width/height"</i> which calculates the height
            based on the height of the viewport with the browser ui minimized
            (90% in case of our example above) and its a static value
          </p>
          <p class="bg-second-color">
            there is also svw and smh which stands for
            <i>"small viewport width/height"</i> which makes the calculations
            based on the viewport in case of maximized browser ui (85% in our
            example above)

      <h2 class="main-heading">grid-auto-flow (dense grid)</h2>
      <div class="container">
        <p>
          according to
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow"
          >

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          "dense" packing algorithm attempts to fill in holes earlier in the
          grid, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear
          out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it is omitted, a "sparse" algorithm is used, where the placement
          algorithm only ever moves "forward" in the grid when placing items,
          never backtracking to fill holes. This ensures that all of the
          auto-placed items appear "in order", even if this leaves holes that
          could have been filled by later items.
        </p>
        <p>
          there are also other value like <span class="cb">row dense</span> and
          <span class="cb">column dense</span>
          and it's not clear in the documentation what it does
        </p>
        <img src="images/grid-auto-flow-row-dense.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          from what I understand in case of
          <span class="cb">row dense</span> items are layed out in a row with
          the suitable items filling the gap below is the difference between
          normal <span class="cb">row</span> and
          <span class="cb">column</span> in terms of how elements are layed out

              </li>
              <li>
                in the pesudo element of the elements that will be repeated
                inside the element you just declared the counter in and type
                <span class="cb"> counter-increment: my-first-counter </span>
                <p class="bg-second-color">
                  obvously you must put the same counter name in the increment
                  as the one you declared
                </p>
                <p>
                  let's say you declared the counter in a class called counter
                  test
                  <span class="cb">
                    <pre>
                      .counter-test {
                        counter-reset: first-counter;
                      }
                    </pre>
                  </span>
                  the counter will start from one in every element that has
                  class of counter-test
                </p>

                after that in pesudo element
                <span class="cb">content: counter(my-first-counter)</span>

                <p>
                  you can also add text before or after the counter
                  <span class="cb"
                    >content: 'this is the element number '
                    counter(my-frist-counter) '. '</span
                  >
                </p>

                <p>
                  let's say you have two lists and you want the second one to
                  continue from where the first one stopped (link lists
                  together):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>simply put them in a parent element</li>
                  <li>declare a counter in the parent</li>
                  <li>
                    add the counter to the pesudo element of the
                    <span class="cb">&lt;li&gt;</span>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    add <span class="cb">list-style: none</span> to hide the
                    bullets or the numbers of the lists
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
